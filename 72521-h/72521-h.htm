  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>How many thousands of educated people,
trained in the best schools, or even graduates
of the great universities, have made the confession:
“I never got a grip on astronomy in
my student days. They didn't make it
either plain or interesting to me; and now I
am sorry for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The purpose of the writer of this book is to
supply the need of such persons, either in
school, or at home, after school-days are
ended. He does not address himself to special
students of the subject—although they, too,
may find the book useful at the beginning—but
to that vast, intelligent public for whom
astronomy is, more or less, a “mystical midland,”
from which, occasionally, fascinating
news comes to their ears. The ordinary
text-book is too overladen with technical
details, and too summary in its treatment of
the general subject, to catch and hold the
attention of those who have no special preliminary
interest in astronomy. The aim
here is to tell all that really needs to be told,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>and no more, and to put it as perspicuously,
compactly, and interestingly, as possible.
For that reason the book is called a “nutshell.”</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The author has been sparing in the use of
diagrams, because he believes that, in many
cases, they have been over-pressed. There is
a tendency to try to represent everything to
the eye. This is well to a certain extent, but
there is danger that by pursuing this method
too far the power of mental comprehension will
be weakened. After all, it is only by an
intelligent use of the imagination that progress
can be made in such a science as astronomy.
The reader is urged to make a serious effort
to understand what is said in the text, and to
picture it in his mind's eye, before referring
to the diagrams. After he has thus presented
the subject to his imagination, he may refer
to the illustrations, and correct with their aid
any misapprehension. For this reason the
cuts, with their descriptions, have been made
independent of the regular text, although
they are placed in their proper connections
throughout the book.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>1. Definition of Astronomy.</b> Astronomy
has to do with the earth, sun, moon, planets,
comets, meteors, stars, and nebulæ; in other
words, with the universe, or “the aggregate
of existing things.” It is the most ancient
of all sciences. The derivation of the name
from two Greek words, <i>aster</i>, “star,” and
<i>nomos</i>, “law,” indicates its nature. It deals
with the <i>law of the stars</i>—the word “star”
being understood, in its widest signification,
as including every heavenly body of whatever
kind. The earth itself is such a body.
Since we happen to live on the earth, it
becomes our standpoint in space, from which
we look out at the others. But, if we lived
on some other planet, we would see the earth
as a distant body in the sky, just as we now
see Jupiter or Mars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Astronomy teaches us that everything in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the universe, from the sun and the moon
to the most remote star or the most extraordinary
nebula, is related to the earth. All
are made of similar elementary substances
and all obey similar physical laws. The
same substance which is a solid upon the
earth may be a gas or a vapour in the sun,
but that does not alter its essential nature.
Iron appears in the sun in the form of a hot
vapour, but fundamentally it is the same
substance which exists on the earth as a
hard, tough, and heavy metal. Its different
states depend upon the temperature to
which it is subjected. The earth is a cool
body, while the sun is an intensely hot
one; consequently iron is solid on the earth
and vaporous in the sun, just as in winter
water is solid ice on the surface of a pond
and steamy vapour over the boiler in the
kitchen. Even on the earth we can make
iron liquid in a blast furnace, and with the
still greater temperatures obtainable in a
laboratory we can turn it into vapour,
thus reducing it to something like the state
in which it regularly exists in the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>This fact, that the entire universe is made
up of similar substances, differing only in
state according to the local circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>affecting them, is the greatest thing that
astronomy has to tell us. It may be regarded
as the fundamental law of the stars.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>2. The Situation of the Earth in the
Heavens.</b> One of the greatest triumphs
of human intelligence is the discovery of the
real place which the earth occupies in the
universe. This discovery has been made in
spite of the most deceptive appearances.
If we accepted the sole evidence of our eyes,
as men once did, we could only conclude that
the earth was the centre of the universe.
In the daytime we see the sun apparently
moving through the sky from east to west,
as if it were travelling in a circle round the
earth, overhead by day and underfoot at
night. In the night-time, we see the stars
apparently travelling round the earth in the
same way as the sun. The fact is, that all
of them are virtually motionless with regard
to the earth, and their apparent movements
through the sky are produced by the earth's
rotation on its axis. The earth turns round
on itself once every twenty-four hours,
like a spinning ball. Imagine a fly on a
rotating school globe; the whole room would
appear to the fly to be revolving round it
as the heavens appear to revolve round the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>earth. It would have to be a very intelligent
insect to correct the deceptive evidence of
its eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The actual facts, revealed by many centuries
of observation and reasoning, are that
the earth is a rotating globe, turning once
on its axis every twenty-four hours and
revolving once round the sun every three
hundred and sixty-five days. The sun is
also a globe, 1,300,000 times larger than the
earth, but so hot that it glows with intense
brilliance, while the substances of which
it consists are kept in a gaseous or vaporous
state. Besides the earth there are seven
other principal globes, or planets, which
revolve round the sun, at various distances
and in various periods, and, in addition
to these, there are hundreds of smaller
bodies, called asteroids or small planets.
There are also many singular bodies called
comets, and swarms of still smaller ones
called meteors, which likewise revolve round
the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>The earth and the other bodies of which
we have just spoken are not only cooler
than the sun, but most of them are in a solid
state and do not shine with light of their
own. The sun furnishes both heat and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>light to the smaller and cooler bodies revolving
round it. In fact, the sun is simply a
<i>star</i>, resembling the thousands of other
stars which surround us in the sky, and
its apparent superiority to them is due only
to the fact that it is relatively near-by while
they are far away. It is probable that all,
or most, of the stars also have planets,
comets, and meteors revolving round them,
but invisible owing to their immense distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “paths” in which the earth and the
other planets and bodies travel in their
revolutions round the sun are called their
orbits. These orbits are all elliptical in
shape, but those of the earth and the other
large planets are not very different from
circles. Some of the asteroids, and all of
the comets, however, travel in elliptical
orbits of considerable eccentricity, <i>i. e.</i>,
which differ markedly from circles. The
orbit of the earth differs so slightly from a
circle that the eccentricity amounts to only
about one-sixtieth. The distance of the earth
from the sun being, on the average, 93,000,000
miles, the eccentricity of its orbit causes it
to approach to within about 91,500,000
miles in winter (of the northern hemisphere)
and to recede to about 94,500,000 miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in summer. The point in its orbit where
the earth is nearest the sun is called perihelion,
and the point where it is farthest
from the sun, aphelion. The earth is at
perihelion about Jan. 1, and at aphelion
about July 4.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, in order to make a general picture in
the mind of the earth's situation, let the
reader suppose himself to be placed out in
space as far from the sun as from the other
stars. Then, if he could see it, he would
observe the earth as a little speck, shining
like a mote in the sunlight, and circling in
its orbit close around the sun. The universe
would appear to him to be somewhat like an
immense spherical room filled with scattered
electric-light bulbs, suspended above, below,
and all around him, each of these bulbs representing
a sun, and if there were minute insects
flying around each light, these insects would
represent the planets belonging to the
various suns. One of the glowing bulbs
among the multitude would stand for our
sun, and one of the insects circling round
it would be the earth.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We have already remarked that the
rotation of the earth on its axis causes all
the other heavenly bodies to <i>appear</i> to revolve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>round it once every twenty-four hours, and
we must now add that the earth's revolution
round the sun causes the same bodies to
<i>appear</i> to make another, slower revolution
round it once every year. This introduces
a complication of apparent motions which it
is the business of astronomy to deal with,
and which we shall endeavour to explain.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>3. The Horizon, the Zenith, and the
Meridian.</b> First, let us consider what is the
ordinary appearance of the sky. When we
go out of doors on a clear night we see the
heavens in the shape of a great dome arched
above us and filled with stars. What we
thus see is one half of the spherical shell
of the heavens which surrounds us on all
sides, the earth being apparently placed at
its centre. The other half is concealed from
our sight behind, or below, the earth. This
spherical shell, of which only one half is
visible to us at a time, is called the celestial
sphere. Now, the surface of the earth
seems to us (for this is another of the
deceptive appearances which astronomy has
to correct) to be a vast flat expanse, whose
level is broken by hills and mountains,
and the visible half of the celestial sphere
seems to bend down on all sides and to rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>upon the earth in a circle which extends all
around us. This circle, where the heavens
and the earth appear to meet, is called the
horizon. As we ordinarily see it, the horizon
appears irregular and broken on account of
the unevenness of the earth's surface, but if
we are at sea, or in the midst of a great level
prairie, the horizon appears as a smooth
circle, everywhere equally distant from the
eye. This circle is called the sensible horizon.
But there is another, ideal, horizon, used in
astronomy, which is called the rational
horizon. It is of the utmost importance
that we should clearly understand what is
meant by the rational horizon, and for this
purpose we must consider another fact concerning
the dome of the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now turn our attention to the centre
of that dome, which, of course, is the point
directly overhead. This point, which is
of primary importance, is called the zenith.
The position of the zenith is indicated by
the direction of a plumb-line. If we imagine
a plumb-line to be suspended from the
centre of the sky overhead, and to pass
into the earth at our feet, it would run through
the centre of the earth, and, if it were continued
onward in the same direction, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>would, after emerging from the other side of
the earth, reach the centre of the invisible
half of the sky-dome at a point diametrically
opposite to the zenith. This central point
of the invisible half of the celestial sphere,
lying under our feet, is called the nadir.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keeping in mind the definitions of zenith
and nadir that have just been given, we are
in a position to understand what the rational
horizon is. It is a great circle whose plane
cuts through the centre of the earth, and
which is situated exactly half-way between
the zenith and the nadir. This plane is
necessarily perpendicular, or at right angles,
to the plumb-line joining the zenith and the
nadir. In other words, the rational horizon
divides the celestial sphere into two precisely
equal halves, an upper and a lower half.
In a hilly or mountainous country the sensible
or visible horizon differs widely from the
rational, or true horizon, but at sea the two
are nearly identical. This arises from the
fact, that the earth is so excessively small in
comparison with the distances of most of the
heavenly bodies that it may be regarded as
a mere point in the midst of the celestial
sphere.</p>

<div id='i012'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 1. The Rational and the Sensible Horizon.</i><br /><br />Let C be the earth's centre, O the place of the observer, and H D the rational horizon passing through the centre of the earth. For an object situated near the earth, as at A, the sensible horizon makes a large angle with the rational horizon. If the object is farther away, as at B, the angle becomes less; and still less, again, if the object is at D. It is evident that if the object be immensely distant, like a star, the sensible horizon O S will be practically parallel with the rational horizon, and will blend with it, because the radius, or semi-diameter, of the earth, O C, is virtually nothing in comparison with the distance of the star.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Besides the horizon and the zenith there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>is one other thing of fundamental importance
which we must learn about before proceeding
further,—the meridian. The meridian
is an imaginary line, or semicircle, beginning
at the north point on the horizon, running
up through the zenith, and then curving
down to the south point. It thus divides the
visible sky into two exactly equal halves,
an eastern and a western half. In the
ordinary affairs of life we usually think only
of that part of the meridian which extends
from the zenith to the south point on the
horizon (which is sometimes called the
"noon-line” because the sun crosses it at
noon), but in astronomy the northern half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of the meridian is as important as the
southern.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>4. Altitude and Azimuth.</b> Now, suppose
that we wish to indicate the location of a
star, or other object, in the sky. To do so,
we must have some fixed basis of reference,
and such a basis is furnished by the horizon
and the zenith. If we tried to describe the
position of a star, the most natural thing
would be, first, to estimate, or measure,
its height above the horizon, and, second, to
indicate the direction in which it was situated
with regard to the points of the compass.
These two measures, if they were accurately
made, would enable another person to find
the star in the sky. And this is precisely
what is done in astronomy. The height
above the horizon is called altitude, and the
bearing with reference to the points of the
compass is called azimuth. Together these
are known as co-ordinates. In order to
systematise this method of measuring the
location of a star, the astronomer uses imaginary
circles drawn on the celestial sphere.
The horizon and the meridian are two of
these circles. In addition to these, other
imaginary circles are drawn parallel to the
horizon and becoming smaller and smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>until the uppermost one may run close round
the zenith, which is the common centre of
the entire set. These are called altitude
circles, because each one throughout its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>whole extent is at an unvarying height, or
altitude, above the horizon. Such circles
may be drawn anywhere we please, so as to
pass through any chosen star or stars. If
two stars in different quarters of the sky
are found to lie on the same circle, then we
know that both have the same altitude.</p>

<div id='i014'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 2. Altitude and Azimuth.</i><br /><br />C is the place of the observer.<br />N C S, a north-and-south line drawn in the plane of the horizon.<br />E C W, an east-and-west line in the plane of the horizon.<br />N E S W, the circle of the horizon.<br />Z, the observer's zenith.<br />N Z S, vertically above N C S, the meridian.<br />E Z W, the prime vertical.<br />Z s s′, part of a vertical circle drawn through the star s.<br />The circle through s parallel to the horizon is an altitude circle.<br />The angle s C s′, or the arc s′ s, represents the star's altitude.<br />The angle s C Z, or the arc Z s, is the star's zenith distance.<br />To find the azimuth, the angular distance round the horizon from S (0°), through W, N, E, to the point where the star's vertical circle meets the horizon, is measured. In this case it is 315°. But if we measured it eastward from the south point it would be—45°.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then another set of circles is drawn perpendicular
to the horizon, and all intersecting
at the zenith and the nadir. These are
called vertical circles, from the fact that they
are upright to the horizon. That one of
the vertical circles which cuts the horizon
at the north-and-south points coincides
with the meridian, which we have already
described. The vertical circle at right
angles to the meridian is called the prime
vertical. It cuts the horizon at the east and
west points, dividing the visible sky into a
northern and a southern half. Like the
altitude circles, vertical circles may be drawn
anywhere we please so as to pass through a
star in any quarter of the sky—but the
meridian and the prime vertical are fixed.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the two sets of circles that have
just been described, it is possible to indicate
accurately the location of any heavenly
body, at any particular moment. Its altitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>is ascertained by measuring, along the
vertical circle passing through it, its distance
from the horizon. (Sometimes it is convenient
to measure, instead of the altitude
of a star, its zenith distance, which is also
reckoned on the vertical circle.)</p>

<p class='c008'>To ascertain the azimuth, we must first
choose a point of beginning on the horizon.
Any of the cardinal points, <i>i.e.</i>, east, west,
north, or south, may be employed for this
purpose, but in astronomy it is customary
to use only the south point, and to carry the
measure westward all round the circle of the
horizon, and so back to the point of beginning
in the south. This involves circular,
or degree, measure, to which a few words
must now be devoted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every circle, no matter how large or how
small, is divided into 360 equal parts, called degrees,
usually indicated by the sign (°); each
degree is subdivided into 60 equal parts called
minutes, indicated by the sign (′); and each
minute is subdivided into 60 equal parts
called seconds, indicated by the sign (″).
Thus there are 360°, or 21,600′, or 1,296,000″
in every complete circle. The actual length
of a degree in inches, yards, or miles, depends
upon the size of the circle, but no circle ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>has more than 360°, and a degree of any
particular circle is precisely equal to any
other degree of that same circle. Thus, if
a circle is 360 miles in circumference, every
one of its degrees will be one mile long.
In mathematics, a degree usually means
not a distance measured along the circumference
of a circle, but an angle formed at
the centre of the circle between two lines
called radii (radius in the singular), which
lines, where they intersect the circumference,
are separated by a distance equal to one
360th of the entire circle. But, for ordinary
purposes, it is simpler to think of a degree
as an arc equal in length to one 360th of
the circle. Now, since the horizon, and
the other imaginary lines drawn in the sky,
are all circles, it is evident that the principle
of circular measure may be applied to them,
and indeed must be so applied in order that
they shall be of use to us in indicating the
position of a star.</p>

<p class='c008'>To return, then, to the measurement of
the azimuth of a star. Since the south
point is the place of beginning, we mark it
0°, and we divide the circle of the horizon
into 360°, counting round westward. Suppose
we see a star somewhere in the south-western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>quarter of the sky; then the point
where the vertical circle passing through
that star intersects the horizon will indicate
its azimuth. Suppose that this point is
found to be 25° west of south; then 25° will
be the star's azimuth. Suppose it is 90°;
then the azimuth is 90°, and the star must
be on the prime vertical in the west, because
west, being one quarter of the way round the
horizon from south, is 90° in angular distance
from the south point. Suppose the azimuth
is 180°; then the star must be on the meridian
north of the zenith, because north is exactly
half-way, or 180° round the horizon from the
south point. Suppose the azimuth is 270°;
then the star must be on the prime vertical
in the east, because east is 270°, or three
quarters of the way round from the south
point. If the star is on the meridian in
the south its azimuth may be called either
0° or 360°, because on any graduated circle
the mark indicating 360° coincides in position
with 0°, that being at the same time the
point of beginning and the point of ending.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same system of angular measure is
applied in ascertaining a star's altitude.
Since the horizon is half-way between the
zenith and the nadir it must be just 90°
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>from either. If a star is in the zenith, then
its altitude is 90°, and if it is below the zenith
its altitude lies somewhere between 0° and
90°. In any case it cannot be less than 0°
nor more than 90°. Having measured the
altitude and the azimuth we have the two
co-ordinates which are needed to indicate
accurately the place of a star in the sky.
But, as we shall see in a moment, other
co-ordinates beside altitude and azimuth
are needed for a complete description of the
places of the stars on the celestial sphere.
Owing to the apparent revolution of the
heavens round the earth, the altitudes and
azimuths of the celestial bodies are continually
changing. We shall now study the causes
of these changes.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>5. The Apparent Motion of the Heavens.</b>
We have likened the earth to a rotating
school globe. As such a globe turns, any
particular spot on it is presented in succession
toward the various sides of the room. In
precisely the same way any spot on the earth
is turned by its rotation successively toward
various parts of the surrounding sky. To
understand the effect of this, a little patient
watching of the actual heavens will be
required, but this has the charm of all out-of-doors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>observation of nature, and it will
be found of fascinating interest as the facts
begin to unfold themselves.</p>

from latitude 40° north, which is the median
latitude of the United States, you must,
after determining as closely as you can the
situation of the north point, look upward
along the meridian in the north until your
eyes are directed to a point about 40° above
the horizon. Forty degrees is somewhat
less than half-way from the horizon to the
zenith, which, as we have seen, are separated
by an arc of 90°. At that point you will
notice a lone star of what astronomers call
the second magnitude. This is the celebrated
North Star. It is the most useful to
man of all the stars, except the sun, and it
differs from all the others in a way presently
to be explained. But first it is essential
that you should make no mistake in identifying
it. There are certain landmarks in
the sky which make such identification
certain. In the first place, it is always so
close to the meridian in the north, that by
naked-eye observation you would probably
never suspect that it was not exactly on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>meridian. Then, its altitude is always equal,
or very nearly equal, to the latitude of the
place where you happen to be on the earth,
so that if you know your latitude you know
how high to carry your eye above the northern
horizon. If you are in latitude 50°,
the star will be at 50° altitude, and if your
latitude is 30°, the altitude of the star will
be 30°. Next you will notice that the North
Star is situated at the end of the handle
of a kind of dipper-shaped figure formed by
stars, the handle being bent the wrong way.
All of the stars forming this “dipper” are
faint, except the two which are farthest from
the North Star, in the outer edge of the bowl,
one of which is about as bright as the North
Star itself. Again, if you carry your eye
along the handle to the bowl, and then
continue onward about as much farther,
you will be led to another, larger, more
conspicuous, and more perfect, dipper-shaped
figure, which is in the famous constellation
of Ursa Major, or the Great Bear.
This striking figure is called the Great
Dipper (known in England as The Wain).
It contains seven conspicuous stars, all
of which, with one exception, are equal in
brightness to the North Star. Now, look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>particularly at the two stars which indicate
the outer side of the bowl of this dipper,
and you will find that if you draw an imaginary
line through them toward the meridian
in the north, it will lead your eye directly
back to the North Star. These two significant
stars are often called The Pointers.
With their aid you can make sure that you
have really found the North Star.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having found it, begin by noting the
various groups of stars, or constellations,
in the northern part of the sky, and, as the
night wears on, observe whether any change
takes place in their position. To make our
description more definite, we will suppose
that the observations begin at nine o'clock
<span class='fss'>P.M.</span> about the 1st of July. At that hour
and date, and from the middle latitudes of
the United States, the Great Dipper is seen
in a south-westerly direction from the North
Star, with its handle pointing overhead.
At the same time, on the opposite side of the
North Star, and low in the north-east,
appears the remarkable constellation of
Cassiopeia, easily recognisable by a zigzag
figure, roughly resembling the letter W,
formed by its five principal stars. Fix the
relative positions of these constellations in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the memory, and an hour later, at 10 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>,
look at them again. You will find that they
have moved, the Great Dipper sinking, while
Cassiopeia rises. Make a third observation
at 11 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and you will perceive that the
motion has continued, The Pointers having
descended in the north-west, until they are
on a level with the North Star, while Cassiopeia
has risen to nearly the same level
in the north-east. In the meantime, the
North Star has remained apparently motionless
in its original position. If you repeat
the observation at midnight, you will
find that the Great Dipper has descended
so far that its centre is on a level with
the North Star, and that Cassiopeia has
proportionally risen in the north-east. It
is just as if the two constellations were
attached to the ends of a rod pivoted at the
centre upon the North Star and twirling
about it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the meantime you will have noticed
that the figure of the “Little Dipper,”
attached to the North Star, which had its
bowl toward the zenith at 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, has swung
round so that at midnight it is extended
toward the south-west. Thus, you will
perceive that the North Star is like a hub
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>round which the heavens appear to turn,
carrying the other stars with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>To convince yourself that this motion is
common to the stars in all parts of the sky,
you should also watch the conduct of those
which pass overhead, and those which are
in the southern quarter of the heavens. For
instance, at 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> (same date), you will
see near the zenith a beautiful coronet
which makes a striking appearance although
all but one of its stars are relatively faint.
This is the constellation Corona Borealis,
or the Northern Crown. As the hours pass
you will see the Crown swing slowly westward,
descending gradually toward the
horizon, and if you persevere in your observations
until about 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, you will see
it set in the north-west. The curve that it
describes is concentric with those followed
by the Great Dipper and Cassiopeia, but,
being farther from the North Star than they
are, and at a distance greater than the
altitude of the North Star, it sinks below
the horizon before it can arrive at a point
directly underneath that star. Then take
a star far in the south. At 9 o'clock, you
will perceive the bright reddish star Antares,
in the constellation Scorpio, rather low in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the south and considerably east of the
meridian. Hour after hour it will move
westward, in a curve larger than that of the
Northern Crown, but still concentric with it.
A little before 10 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, it will cross the
meridian, and between 1 and 2 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, it
will sink beneath the horizon at a point south
of west.</p>

<p class='c008'>So, no matter in what part of the heavens
you watch the stars, you will see not only
that they move from east to west, but that
this motion is performed in curves concentric
round the North Star, which alone appears
to maintain its place unchanged. Along
the eastern horizon you will perceive stars
continually rising; in the middle of the sky
you will see others continually crossing the
meridian—a majestic march of constellations,—and
along the western horizon you will find
still others continually setting. If you could
watch the stars uninterruptedly throughout
the twenty-four hours (if daylight did
not hide them from sight during half that
period), you would perceive that they go
entirely round the celestial sphere, or rather
that it goes round with them, and that at
the end of twenty-four hours they return to
their original positions. But you can do this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>just as well by looking at them on two successive
nights, when you will find that at the
same hour on the second night they are back
again, practically in the places where you
saw them on the first night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, what happens on a July night
happens on any other night of the year.
We have taken a particular date merely
in order to make the description clearer.
It is only necessary to find the North Star,
the Great Dipper, and Cassiopeia, and you
can observe the apparent revolution of the
heavens at any time of the year. These
constellations, being so near the North
Star that they never go entirely below the
horizon in middle northern latitudes, are
always visible on one side or another of the
North Star.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, call upon your imagination to deal
with what you have been observing, and you
will have no difficulty in explaining what
all this apparent motion of the stars means.
You already know that the heavens form
a sphere surrounding the earth. You have
simply to suppose the North Star to be
situated at, or close to, the north end, or
north pole, of an imaginary axle, or axis,
round which the celestial sphere seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>turn, and instantly the whole series of
phenomena will fall into order, and the
explanation will stare you in the face. That
explanation is that the motion of all the
stars in concentric circles round the North
Star is due to an apparent revolution of
the whole celestial sphere, like a huge
hollow ball, about an axis, the position of
one of whose poles is graphically indicated
in the sky by the North Star. The circles
in which the stars seem to move are
perpendicular to this axis, and inclined
to the horizon at an angle depending
upon the altitude of the North Star at the
place on the earth where the observations
are made.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another important fact demands our
attention, although the thoughtful reader
will already have guessed it—the north pole
of the celestial sphere, whose position in the
sky is closely indicated by the North Star,
is situated directly over the north pole
of the earth. This follows from the fact that
the apparent revolution of the celestial
sphere is due to the real rotation of the earth.
You can see that the two poles, that of the
earth and that of the heavens, must necessarily
coincide, by taking a school globe and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>imagining that you are an intelligent little
being dwelling on its surface. As the globe
turned on its axis you would see the walls of
the room revolving round you, and the poles
of the apparent axis round which the room
turned, would, evidently, be directly over
the corresponding poles of the globe itself.
Another thing which you could make clear
by this experiment is that, as the poles of
the celestial sphere are over the earth's
poles, so the celestial equator, or equator
of the heavens, must be directly over the
equator of the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can determine the location of the
poles of the heavens by watching the revolution
of the stars around them, and we can
fix the position of the circle of the equator
of the heavens, by drawing an imaginary
line round the celestial sphere, half-way
between the two poles. We have spoken
specifically only of the north pole, but, of
course, there is a corresponding south pole
situated over the south pole of the earth,
but whose position is invisible from the
northern hemisphere. It happens that the
place of the south celestial pole is not indicated
to the eye, like that of the northern,
by a conspicuous star.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><b>6. Locating the Stars on the Celestial
Sphere.</b> Having found the poles and the
equator of the celestial sphere, we begin
to see how it is possible to make a map,
or globe, of the heavens just as we do of the
earth, on which the objects that they contain
may be represented in their proper positions.
When we wish to describe the location of
an object on the earth, a city for instance,
we have to refer to a system of imaginary
circles, drawn round the earth and based
upon the equator and the poles. These
circles enable us to fix the place of any point
on the earth with accuracy. One set of
circles called parallels of latitude are drawn
east and west round the globe parallel to
the equator, and becoming smaller and
smaller until the smallest runs close round
their common central point, which is one
of the poles. Each pole of the earth is the
centre of such a set of circles all parallel to
the equator. Since each circle is unvarying
in its distance from the equator, all places
which are situated anywhere on that circle
have the same latitude, or distance from the
equator, either north or south.</p>

<p class='c008'>But to know the latitude of any place on
the earth is not sufficient; we must also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>know what is called its longitude, or its
angular distance east or west of some chosen
point on the equator. This knowledge is
obtained with the aid of another set of circles
drawn north-and-south round the earth,
and all meeting and crossing at the poles.
These are called meridians of longitude.
In order to make use of them we must,
as already intimated, select some particular
meridian whose crossing point on the equator
will serve as a place of beginning. By
common consent of the civilised world, the
meridian which passes through the observatory
at Greenwich, near London, has been
chosen for this purpose. It is, like all the
meridians, perpendicular to the equator,
and it is called the prime meridian of the
earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In locating any place on the earth, then,
we ascertain by means of the parallel of
latitude passing through it how far in
degrees, it is north or south of the equator,
and by means of its meridian of longitude
how far it is east or west of the prime meridian,
or meridian of Greenwich. These
two things being known, we have the exact
location of the place on the earth. Let us
now see how a similar system is applied to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>ascertain the location of a heavenly body
on the celestial sphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have observed that the poles of the
heavens correspond in position, or direction,
with those of the earth, and that the equator
of the heavens runs round the sky directly
over the earth's equator. It follows that
we can divide the celestial sphere just as
we do the surface of the earth by means of
parallels and meridians, corresponding to the
similar circles of the earth. On the earth,
distance from the equator is called latitude,
and distance from the prime meridian,
longitude. In the heavens, distance from
the equator is called declination, and distance
from the prime meridian, right ascension;
but they are essentially the same things
as latitude and longitude, and are measured
virtually in the same way. In place of
parallels of latitude, we have on the celestial
sphere circles drawn parallel to the equator
and centring about the celestial poles,
which are called parallels of declination,
and in place of meridians of longitude, we
have circles perpendicular to the equator,
and drawn through the celestial poles,
which are called hour circles. The origin
of this name will be explained in a moment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>For the present it is only necessary to fix
firmly in the mind the fact that these two
systems of circles, one on the earth and the
other in the heavens, are fundamentally
identical.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as on the earth geographers have
chosen a particular place, viz. Greenwich,
to fix the location of the terrestrial prime
meridian, so astronomers have agreed upon
a particular point in the heavens which
serves to determine the location of the
celestial prime meridian. This point, which
lies on the celestial equator, is known as the
vernal equinox. We shall explain its origin
after having indicated its use. The hour
circle which passes through the vernal
equinox is the prime meridian of the heavens,
and the vernal equinox itself is sometimes
called the “Greenwich of the Sky.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If, now, we wish to ascertain the exact
location of a star on the celestial sphere, as
we would that of New York, London, or
Paris, on the earth, we measure along the hour
circle running through it, its declination,
or distance from the celestial equator, and
then, along its parallel of declination, we
measure its right ascension, or distance
from the vernal equinox. Having these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>two co-ordinates, we possess all that is necessary
to enable us to describe the position
of the star, so that someone else looking for
it, may find it in the sky, as a navigator
finds some lone island in the sea by knowing
its latitude and longitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>Declination, as we have seen, is simply
another name for latitude, but right ascension,
which corresponds to longitude, needs a
little additional explanation. It differs from
longitude, first, in that, instead of being reckoned
both east and west from the prime
meridian, it is reckoned only toward the east,
the reckoning being continued uninterruptedly
entirely round the circle of the
equator; and, second, in that it is usually
counted not in degrees, minutes, and seconds
of arc, but in hours, minutes, and seconds
of time. The reason for this is that,
since the celestial sphere makes one complete
revolution in twenty-four hours, it
is convenient to divide the circuit into
twenty-four equal parts, each corresponding
to the distance through which the
heavens appear to turn in one hour. This
explains the origin of the term hour circles
applied to the celestial meridians, which,
by intersecting the equator, divide it into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>twenty-four equal parts, each part corresponding
to an hour of time. In expressing
right ascension in time, the Roman
numerals—<span class='fss'>I</span>, <span class='fss'>II</span>, <span class='fss'>III</span>, <span class='fss'>IV</span>, <span class='fss'>V</span>, <span class='fss'>VI</span>, <span class='fss'>VII</span>, <span class='fss'>VIII</span>, <span class='fss'>IX</span>, <span class='fss'>X</span>, <span class='fss'>XI</span>, <span class='fss'>XII</span>, <span class='fss'>XIII</span>, <span class='fss'>XIV</span>, <span class='fss'>XV</span>, <span class='fss'>XVI</span>, <span class='fss'>XVII</span>, <span class='fss'>XVIII</span>, <span class='fss'>XIX</span>, <span class='fss'>XX</span>, <span class='fss'>XXI</span>, <span class='fss'>XXII</span>, <span class='fss'>XXIII</span>, <span class='fss'>XXIV</span>—are
employed for the hours, and the letters
<i>m</i> and <i>s</i> respectively for the minutes and
seconds. Since there are 360° in every
circle, it is plain that one hour of right ascension
corresponds to 15°. So, too, one minute
of right ascension corresponds to 15′, and
one second to 15″. It will be found useful
to memorise these relations.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>7. Effects Produced by Changing the
Observer's Place on the Earth.</b> The reader
will recall that in Sect. 4 we described another
system of circles for determining the
places of stars, a system based on the horizon
and the zenith. This horizon-zenith system
takes no account of the changes produced
by the apparent motion of the heavens,
and consequently it is not applicable to
determining the absolute positions of the
stars on the celestial sphere. It simply
shows their positions in the visible half of
the sky, as seen at some particular time
from some definite point on the earth. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>order to show the changing relations of this
system to that which we have just been describing,
let us consider the effects produced
by shifting our place of observation on the
earth. Since the zenith is the point overhead
and the nadir the point underfoot, and the
horizon is a great circle drawn exactly half-way
between the zenith and the nadir, it
is evident, upon a moment's consideration,
that every place on the earth has its own
zenith and its own horizon. It is also clear
that every place must have its own meridian,
because the meridian is a north-and-south
line running directly over the observer's
head. You can see how this is, if you reflect
that for an observer situated on the other
side of the earth what is overhead for you
will be underfoot for him, and <i>vice versa</i>.
Thus the direction of our zenith is the
direction of the nadir for our antipodes,
and the direction of their zenith is the
direction of our nadir. They see the half
of the sky which is invisible to us, and we
the half which is invisible to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, suppose that we should go to the
north pole. The celestial north pole would
then be in our zenith, and the equator would
correspond with the horizon. Thus, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>an observer at the north pole the two systems
of circles that we have described would fall
into coincidence. The zenith would correspond
with the pole of the heavens; the
horizon would correspond with the celestial
equator; the vertical circles would correspond
with the hour circles; and the altitude
circles would correspond with the circles of
declination. The North Star, being close
to the pole of the heavens, would appear
directly overhead. Being at the zenith,
its altitude would be 90° (see Sect. 4).
Peary, if he had visited the pole during the
polar night, would have seen the North
Star overhead, and it would have enabled
him with relatively little trouble to determine
his exact place on the earth, or, in other
words, the exact location of the north
terrestrial pole. With the pole star in the
zenith, it is evident that the other stars
would be seen revolving round it in circles
parallel to the horizon. All the stars
situated north of the celestial equator would
be simultaneously and continuously visible.
None of them would either rise or set, but
all, in the course of twenty-four hours, would
appear to make a complete circuit horizontally
round the sky. This polar presentation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>celestial sphere is called the parallel sphere,
because the stars appear to move parallel
to the horizon. No man has yet beheld
the nocturnal phenomena of the parallel
sphere, but if in the future some explorer
should visit one of the earth's poles during
the polar night, he would behold the spectacle
in all its strange splendour.</p>

<div id='i038'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><b>Jupiter</b><br /><br />Photographed at the Lick Observatory.<br />Observe on the left the Great Red Spot, which first appeared in 1878.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Next, suppose that you are somewhere
on the earth's equator. Since the equator
is everywhere 90°, or one quarter of a circle,
from each pole, it is evident that looking at
the sky from the equator you would see the
two poles (if there was anything to mark
their places) lying on the horizon one exactly
in the north and the other exactly in the
south. The celestial equator would correspond
with the prime vertical, passing
east and west directly over your head, and
all the stars would rise and set perpendicularly
to the horizon, each describing a semicircle
in the sky in the course of twelve
hours. During the other twelve hours, the
same stars would be below the horizon. Stars
situated near either of the poles would describe
little semi-circles near the north or
the south point; those farther away would
describe larger semi-circles; those close to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the celestial equator would describe semi-circles
passing overhead. But all, no matter
where situated, would describe their visible
courses in the same period of time. This
equatorial presentation of the celestial sphere
is called the right sphere, because the stars
rise and set at a right angle to the plane of
the horizon. Comparing it with the system
of circles on which right ascension and declination
are based, we see that, as the prime
vertical corresponds with the celestial equator,
so the horizon must represent an hour
circle. The meridian also represents an hour
circle. It may require a little thought to
make this clear, but it will be a good
exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, if you are somewhere between the
equator and one of the poles, which is the
actual situation of the vast majority of mankind,
you see either the north or the south
pole of the heavens elevated to an altitude
corresponding with your latitude, and the
stars apparently revolving round it in circles
inclined to the horizon at an angle depending
upon the latitude. The nearer you are to
the equator, the steeper this angle will be.
This ordinary presentation of the celestial
sphere is called the oblique sphere. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>horizon does not correspond with either the
equator or the prime vertical, and its zenith
and nadir lie at points situated between the
celestial poles and the celestial equator.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>8. The Astronomical Clock and the Ecliptic.</b>
It will be remembered that the meridian
of any place on the earth is a straight north
and south line running through the zenith
and perpendicular to the horizon. More
strictly speaking, the meridian is a circle
passing from north to south directly overhead
and corresponding exactly with the meridian
of longitude of the place of observation.
Now, let us consider the hour circles on the
celestial sphere. They are drawn in the
same way as the meridians on the earth.
But the celestial sphere appears to revolve
round the earth, and as it does so it must
carry the hour circles with it, since they are
fixed in position upon its surface. Fix
your attention upon the first of these hour
circles, <i>i. e.</i>, the one which runs through the
vernal equinox. Its right ascension is called
0 hours, because it is the starting point.
Suppose that at some time we find the vernal
equinox exactly in the south; then the 0
hour circle, or the prime meridian of the
heavens, will, at that instant, coincide with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the meridian of the place of observation.
But one hour later, in consequence of the
motion of the heavens, the vernal equinox,
together with the circle of 0 hours, will be
15°, or one hour of right ascension, west
of the meridian, and the hour circle marked
<span class='fss'>I</span> will have come up to, and for an instant will
be blended with, the meridian. An hour
later still, the circle of <span class='fss'>II</span> hours right ascension
will have taken its place on the meridian,
while the vernal equinox and the circle of 0
hours will be <span class='fss'>II</span> hours, or 30°, west of the
meridian. And so on, throughout the entire
circuit of the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>What has just been said makes it evident
that the apparent motion of the heavens
resembles the movement of a clock, the
vernal equinox, or the circle of 0 hours,
serving as a hand, or pointer, on the dial.
Astronomers use it in exactly that way, for
astronomical clocks are made with dials
divided into twenty-four hour spaces, and the
time reckoning runs continuously from 0
hours to <span class='fss'>XXIV</span> hours. The “astronomical
day” begins when the vernal equinox is on the
meridian. At that instant the hands of the
astronomical clock mark 0 hours, 0 minutes,
0 seconds. Thus the clock follows the motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of the heavens, and the astronomer can tell
by simply glancing at the dial, and without
looking at the sky, where the vernal equinox
is, and what is the right ascension of any
body which may at that moment be on the
meridian.</p>

<p class='c008'>We must now explain a little more fully
what the vernal equinox is, and why it has
been chosen as the “Greenwich of the Sky.”
Its position is not marked by any star, but
is determined by means of the intersecting
circles that we have described. There is
one other such circle, that we have not yet
mentioned, which bears a peculiar relation
to the vernal equinox. This is the ecliptic.
Just as the daily, or diurnal, rotation of the
earth on its axis causes the whole celestial
sphere to appear to make one revolution
every day, so the yearly or annual revolution
of the earth in its orbit about the sun causes
the sun to appear to make one revolution
through the sky every year. As the earth
moves onward in its orbit, the sun seems to
move in the opposite direction. Inasmuch
as there are 360° in a complete circle and
365 days in a year, the apparent motion of
the sun amounts to nearly 1° per day, or
30° per month. In twelve months, then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the sun comes back again to the place in the
sky which it occupied at the beginning of the
year. Since the motion of the earth in its
orbit is from west to east (the same as that
of its rotation on its axis), it follows that
the direction of the sun's apparent annual
motion in the sky is from east to west
(like its daily motion). Thus, while <i>in
fact</i> the earth pursues a path, or orbit, round
the sun, the sun <i>seems</i> to pursue a path
round the earth. This apparent path of
the sun, projected against the background
of the sky, is called the ecliptic. The name
arises from the fact that eclipses only occur
when the moon is in or near the plane of the
sun's apparent path.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the apparent motion of the sun round
the ecliptic is caused by the real motion
of the earth round the sun, we may regard
the ecliptic as a circle marking the intersection
of the plane of the earth's orbit
with the celestial sphere. In other words,
if we were situated on the sun instead of on
the earth, we would see the earth travelling
round the sky in the circle of the ecliptic.
We must keep this fact, that the ecliptic indicates
the plane of the earth's orbit, firmly
in mind, in order to understand what follows.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The ecliptic is not coincident with the
celestial equator, for the following reason:
The axis of the earth's daily rotation is not
parallel to, or does not point in the same
direction as, the axis of its yearly revolution
round the sun. As the axis of rotation is
perpendicular to the equator, so the axis of
the yearly revolution is perpendicular to
the ecliptic, and since these two axes are
inclined to one another, it results that the
equator and the ecliptic must lie in different
planes. The inclination of the plane of the
ecliptic to that of the equator amounts to
about 23½°.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it is very important to have a clear
conception of this subject, we may illustrate
it in this way: Take a ball to represent the
earth, and around it draw a circle to represent
the equator. Then, through the centre of
the ball, and at right angles to its equator,
put a long pin to represent the axis. Set it
afloat in a tub of water, weighting it so that
it will be half submerged, and placing it in
such a position that the pin will be not upright
but inclined at a considerable angle from the
vertical. Now, imagine that the sun is
situated in the centre of the tub, and cause
the ball to circle slowly round it, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>maintaining the pin always in the same position.
Then the surface of the water will
represent the plane of the ecliptic, or plane
of the earth's orbit, and you will see that,
in consequence of the inclination of the pin,
the plane of the equator does not coincide
with that of the ecliptic (or the surface of
the water), but is tipped with regard to it
in such a manner that one half of the equator
is below and the other half above it. Instead
of actually trying this experiment, it will be
a useful exercise of the imagination to represent
it to the mind's eye just as if it
were tried.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have said that the inclination of the
equator to the ecliptic amounts to 23½°,
and this angle should be memorised. Now,
since both the ecliptic and the equator are
great circles of the celestial sphere, <i>i. e.</i>,
circles whose planes cut through the centre
of the sphere, they must intersect one
another at two opposite points. In the
experiment just described, these two points
lie on opposite sides of the ball, where the
equator cuts the level of the water. These
points of intersection of the equator and the
ecliptic on the celestial sphere are called
the equinoxes, or equinoctial points, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>when the sun appears at either of those points
it is perpendicular over the equator, and when
it is in that position day and night are of
equal length all over the earth. (Equinox
is from two Latin words meaning “equal
night.”)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We shall have more to say about the
equinoxes later, but for the present it is
sufficient to remark that one of these points—that
one where the sun is about the 21st
of March, which is the beginning of astronomical
spring—is the “Greenwich of the
Sky,” or the vernal equinox. The other,
opposite, point is called the autumnal
equinox, because the sun arrives there
about the 23d of September, the beginning
of astronomical autumn. The vernal equinox,
as we have already seen, serves as a
pointer on the dial of the sky. When it
crosses the meridian of any place it is
astronomical noon at that place. Its
position in the sky is not marked by any
particular star, but it is situated in the
constellation Pisces, and lies exactly at the
crossing point of the celestial equator and
the ecliptic. The hour circle, running through
this point, and through its opposite, the
autumnal equinox, is the prime meridian of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the heavens, called the equinoctial colure.
The hour circle at right angles to the equinoctial
colure, <i>i. e.</i>, bearing to it the same
relation that the prime vertical does to
the meridian (see Sect. 4), is called the solstitial
colure. This latter circle cuts
the ecliptic at two opposite points, called
the solstices, which lie half-way between the
equinoxes. Since the ecliptic is inclined
23½° to the plane of the equator, and since
the solstices lie half-way between the two
crossing points of the ecliptic and the equator,
it is evident that the solstices must be
situated 23½° from the equator, one above
and the other below, or one north and the
other south. The northern one is called
the summer solstice, because the sun arrives
there at the beginning of astronomical summer,
about the 22d of June, and the southern
one is called the winter solstice, because the
sun arrives there at the beginning of the
astronomical winter, about the 22d of
December. The name solstice comes from
two Latin words meaning “the standing still
of the sun,” because when it is at the solstitial
points its apparent course through the
sky is for several days nearly horizontal
and its declination changes very slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Now, just as there are two opposite
points in the sky at equal distances from the
equator, which mark the poles of the imaginary
axis about which the celestial sphere
makes its diurnal revolution, so there are
two opposite points at equal distances from
the ecliptic which mark the poles of the
imaginary axis about which the yearly
revolution of the sun takes place. These
are called the poles of the ecliptic, and they
are situated 23½° from the celestial poles—a
distance necessarily corresponding with
the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator.
The northern pole of the ecliptic is in the
constellation Draco, which you may see any
night circling round the North Star, together
with the Great Dipper and Cassiopeia.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>9. Celestial Latitude and Longitude.</b> We
have seen that the celestial sphere is marked
with imaginary circles resembling the circles
of latitude and longitude on the earth, and
that in both cases the circles are used for
a similar purpose, viz., to determine the
location of objects, in one case on the globe
of the earth and in the other on the sphere
of the heavens. It has also been explained
that what corresponds to latitude on the
celestial sphere is called declination, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>what corresponds to longitude is called
right ascension. It happens, however, that
these same terms, latitude and longitude,
are also employed in astronomy. But, unfortunately,
they are based upon a different
set of circles from that which has been
described, and they do not correspond in
the way that right ascension and declination
do to terrestrial longitude and latitude. A
few words must therefore be devoted to
celestial latitude and longitude, as distinguished
from declination and right ascension.</p>

<p class='c008'>Celestial latitude and longitude then,
instead of being based upon the equator and
the poles, are based upon the ecliptic and
the poles of the ecliptic. Celestial latitude
means distance north or south of the ecliptic
(not of the equator), and celestial longitude
means distance from the vernal equinox
reckoned along the ecliptic (not along the
equator). Celestial longitude runs, the
same as right ascension, from west toward
east, but it is reckoned in degrees instead
of hours. Celestial latitude is measured
the same as declination, but along circles
running through the poles of the ecliptic
instead of the celestial poles, and drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>perpendicular to the ecliptic instead of to
the equator. Circles of celestial latitude
are drawn parallel to the ecliptic and centring
round the poles of the ecliptic, and
meridians of celestial longitude are drawn
through the poles of the ecliptic and perpendicular
to the ecliptic itself. The
meridian of celestial longitude that passes
through the two equinoxes is the ecliptic
prime meridian. This intersects the equinoctial
colure at the equinoctial points,
making with it an angle of 23½°. The
solstitial colure, which it will be remembered
runs round the celestial sphere half-way
between the equinoxes, is perpendicular
to the ecliptic as well as to the equator, and
so is common to the two systems of circles.
It passes alike through the celestial poles
and the poles of the ecliptic. It will also
be observed that the vernal equinox is common
to the two systems of co-ordinates, because
it lies at one of the intersections of the
ecliptic and the equator. In passing from one
system to the other, the astronomer employs
the methods of spherical trigonometry.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>10. The Zodiac and the Precession of the
Equinoxes.</b> The next thing with which we
must make acquaintance is the zodiac.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>We have learned that the ecliptic is a great
circle of the celestial sphere inclined at an
angle of 23½° to the equator, and crossing
the latter at two opposite points called the
equinoxes, and that the sun in its annual
journey round the sky follows the circle of
the ecliptic. Consequently, the place which
the sun occupies at any time must be
somewhere on the course of the ecliptic.
The fact has been mentioned that as seen
from the sun the earth would appear to
travel round the ecliptic, whence the ecliptic
may be regarded as the projection of the
earth's orbit, or path, against the background
of the heavens. But, besides the
earth there are seven other large planets,
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune, which, like it, revolve
round the sun, some nearer and some farther
away. Now, the orbits of all of these planets
lie in planes nearly coincident with that of
the earth's orbit. None of them is inclined
more than 7° from the ecliptic and most
of them are inclined only one or two degrees.
Consequently, as we watch these planets
moving slowly round in their orbits we find
that they are always quite close to the
circle of the ecliptic. This fact shows that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the solar system, <i>i. e.</i>, the sun and its attendant
planets, occupies a disk-shaped area
in space, the outlines of which would be
like those of a very thin round cheese, with
the sun in the centre. The ecliptic indicates
the median plane of this imaginary disk.
The moon, too, travels nearly in this common
plane, its orbit round the earth being inclined
only a little more than 5° to the ecliptic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the early astronomers noticed these
facts, and in ancient times they gave to the
apparent road round the sky in which the
sun and planets travel, in tracks relatively
as close together as the parallel marks of
wheels on a highway, the name zodiac.
They assigned to it a certain arbitrary width,
sufficient to include the orbits of all the
planets known to them. This width is
8° on each side of the circle of the ecliptic,
or 16° in all. They also divided the ring of
the zodiac into twelve equal parts, corresponding
with the number of months in a
year, and each part was called a sign of the
zodiac. Since there are 360° in a circle,
each sign of the zodiac has a length of just
30°. To indicate the course of the zodiac
to the eye, its inventors observed the constellations
lying along it, assigning one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>constellation to each sign. Beginning at
the vernal equinox, and running round eastward,
they gave to these zodiacal constellations,
as well as to the corresponding signs,
names drawn from fancy resemblances of
the figures formed by the stars to men,
animals, or other objects. The first sign
and constellation were called Aries, the
Ram, indicated by the symbol ♈︎; the
second, Taurus, the Bull, ♉︎; the third,
Gemini, the Twins, ♊︎; the fourth, Cancer,
the Crab, ♋︎; the fifth, Leo, the Lion, ♌︎; the
sixth, Virgo, the Virgin, ♍︎; the seventh,
Libra, the Balance, ♎︎; the eighth, Scorpio,
the Scorpion, ♏︎; the ninth, Sagittarius, the
Archer, ♐︎; the tenth, Capricornus, the
Goat, ♑︎; the eleventh, Aquarius, the Water-Bearer, ♒︎;
and the twelfth, Pisces, the
Fishes, ♓︎. The name zodiac comes from a
Greek word for animal, since most of the
imaginary figures formed by the stars of
the zodiacal constellations are those of
animals. The signs and their corresponding
constellations being supposed fixed in the
sky, the planets, together with the sun and
the moon, were observed to run through them
in succession from west to east.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this system was invented, the signs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and their constellations coincided in position,
but in the course of time it was
found that they were drifting apart, the signs,
whose starting point remained the vernal
equinox, backing westward through the sky
until they became disjoined from their
proper constellations. At present the sign
Aries is found in the constellation next west
of its original position, viz., Pisces, and so on
round the entire circle. This motion, as
already intimated, carries the equinoxes
along with the signs, so that the vernal
equinox, which was once at the beginning
of the constellation Aries (as it still is at
the beginning, or “first point,” of the <i>sign</i>
Aries), is now found in the constellation
Pisces.</p>

<p class='c008'>To explain the shifting of the signs of the
zodiac on the face of the sky we must
consider the phenomenon known as the
precession of the equinoxes, which is one of
the most interesting things in astronomy.
Let us refer again to the fact that the axis
of the earth's daily rotation is inclined 23½°
from a perpendicular to the plane of its
yearly revolution round the sun, from which
it results that the ecliptic is tipped at the
same angle to the plane of the equator.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Thus the sun, moving in the ecliptic, appears
half the year above (or north of) the equator,
and half the year below (or south of) it,
the crossing points being the two equinoxes.
Now, this inclination of the earth's axis
is the key to the explanation we are seeking.
The direction in which the axis lies in space
is a <i>fixed</i> direction, which can be changed only
by some outside force interfering. What
we mean by this will become clearer if we
think of the earth's axis as resembling the
peg of a top, or the axis of a gyroscope.
When a top is spinning smoothly, with its
peg vertical, the peg will remain vertical as
long as the spin is not diminished, and no
outside force interferes. So, too, the axis of
the spinning-wheel of a gyroscope keeps
pointing in the same direction so persistently
that the wheel is kept from falling. If it
is so mounted that it is free to move in any
direction, and if then you take the instrument
in your hand and turn round with it,
the axis will adjust itself in such a manner
as to retain its original direction in space.
This tendency of a rotating body to keep
its axis of rotation fixed applies equally to
the earth, whose axis, also, maintains a
constant direction in space, except for a slow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>change produced by outside forces, which
change constitutes the phenomenon of the
precession of the equinoxes.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot too often recall the fact that
the axis of the earth is coincident in direction
with that of the celestial sphere, so that the
earth's poles are situated directly under the
celestial poles. But the poles of the ecliptic
are 23½° aside from the celestial poles.
If the direction of the earth's axis and
with it that of the celestial sphere, did
not change at all, then the celestial poles
and the poles of the ecliptic would always
retain the same relative positions in the sky;
but, in fact, an exterior force, acting upon
the earth, causes a gradual change in the
direction of its axis, and in consequence of
this change the celestial poles, whose position
depends upon that of the earth's poles,
have a slow motion of revolution about the
poles of the ecliptic, in a circle of 23½°
radius. The force which produces this effect
is the attraction of the sun and the moon
upon the protuberant part of the earth
round its equator. If the earth were a
perfect sphere, this force could not act,
or would not exist, but since the earth is an
oblate spheroid, slightly flattened at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>poles, and bulged round the equator, the
attraction acts upon the equatorial protuberance
in such a way as to strive to pull the
earth's axis into an upright position with
respect to the plane of the ecliptic. But,
in consequence of its spinning motion, the
earth resists this pull, and tries, so to speak,
to keep the inclination of its axis unchanged.
The result is that the axis swings slowly round
while maintaining nearly the same inclination
to the plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, again, we may employ the illustration
of a top. If the peg of the top is tipped a
little aside, so that the attraction of gravitation
would cause the top to fall flat on the
table if it were not spinning, it will, as long
as it continues to spin, swing round and round
in a circle instead of falling. We cannot
enter into a mathematical explanation of
this phenomenon here, but the reader will
find a clear popular account of the whole
matter in Prof. John Perry's little book
on <i>Spinning Tops</i>. It is sufficient here
to say that the attraction of gravitation,
tending to make the top fall, but really
causing the peg to turn round and round,
resembles, in its effect, the attraction of the
sun and the moon upon the equatorial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>protuberance of the earth, which makes the
earth's axis turn round in space.</p>

<div id='i058'  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now, as we have said, this slow swinging
round of the axis of the earth produces the
so-called precession of the equinoxes. In a
period of about 25,800 years, the axis makes
one complete swing round, so that in that
space of time the celestial poles describe
a revolution about the poles of the ecliptic,
which remain fixed. But since the equator
is a circle situated half-way between the poles,
it is evident that it must turn also. To
illustrate this, take a round flat disk of tin,
or pasteboard, to represent the equator and
its plane, and perpendicularly through its
centre run a straight rod to represent the
axis. Put one end of the axis on the table,
and, holding it at a fixed inclination, turn
the upper end round in a circle. You
will see that as the axis thus revolves, the
disk revolves with it, and if you imagine a
plane, parallel to the surface of the table,
passing through the centre of the disk at
the point where the rod pierces it, you will
perceive that the two opposite points, where
the edge of the disk intersects this imaginary
plane, revolve with the disk. In one position
of the axis, for instance, these points may lie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in the direction of the north-and-south sides
of the room. When you have revolved the
axis, and with it the disk, one quarter way
round, the points will lie toward the east
and west sides of the room. When you have
produced a half revolution they will once
more lie toward the north-and-south, but
now the direction of the slope of the disk
will be the reverse of that which it had at
the beginning. Finally, when the revolution
is completed, the two points will again lie
north-and-south and the slope of the disk
will be in the same direction as at the start.
In this illustration the disk stands for the
plane of the celestial equator, the rod for
the axis of the celestial sphere, the imaginary
plane parallel to the surface of the table for
the plane of the ecliptic, and the two opposite
points where this plane is intersected by the
edge of the disk for the equinoxes. The
motion of these points as the inclined disk
revolves represents the precession of the
equinoxes. This term means that the
direction of the motion of the equinoxes,
as they shift their place on the ecliptic,
is such that they seem to precess, or move
forward, as if to meet the sun in its annual
journey round the ecliptic. The direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>is from east to west, and thus the zodiacal
signs are carried farther and farther westward
from the constellations originally associated
with them; for these signs, as we have said,
are so arranged that they begin at the vernal
equinox, and if the equinox moves, the
whole system of signs must move with it.
The amount of the motion is about 50″.2
per year, and since there are 1,296,000″
in a circle, simple division shows that the
time required for one complete revolution of
the equinoxes must be, as already stated in
reference to the poles, about 25,800 years.
A little over 2000 years ago the signs and the
constellations were in accord; it follows,
then, that about 23,800 years in the future,
they will be in accord again. In the meanwhile
the signs will have backed entirely
round the circle of the ecliptic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The attentive reader will perceive that
the precession of the equinoxes, with its
attendant revolution of the celestial poles
round the poles of the ecliptic, must affect
the position of the North Star. We have already
said that that star only <i>happens</i> to
occupy its present commanding position
in the sky. The star itself is motionless,
or practically so, with regard to the earth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and it is the north pole that changes its place.
At the present time the pole is about 1° 10,
from the North Star, in the direction of the
Great Dipper, and it is slowly drawing nearer
so that in about 200 years it will be less than
half a degree from the star. After that the
precessional motion will carry the pole in a
circle departing farther and farther from the
star, until the latter will have entirely lost
its importance as a guide to the position of
the pole. It happens, however, that several
other conspicuous stars lie near this circle.
One of these is Thuban, or Alpha Draconis
(not now as bright as it once was), and this
star at the time when it served as an indicator
of the place of the pole, some 4600 years ago,
was connected with a very romantic chapter
in the history of astronomy. In the great
pyramid of Cheops in Egypt, there is a long
passage leading straight toward the north
from a chamber cut deep in the rock under
the centre of the pyramid, and the upward
slope of this passage is such that it is believed
to have been employed by the Egyptian
astronomer-priests as a kind of telescope-tube
for viewing the then pole star, and
observing the times of its passage over the
meridian—for even the North Star, since it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>is not <i>exactly</i> at the pole, revolves every
twenty-four hours in a tiny circle about it,
and consequently crosses the meridian twice
a day, once above and once beneath the true
pole.</p>

<p class='c008'>About 11,500 years in the future, the
extremely brilliant star Vega, or Alpha
Lyræ, will serve as a pole star, although
it will not be as near the pole as the North
Star now is. At that time the North Star
will be nearly 50° from the pole. In about
21,000 years the pole will have come round
again to the neighbourhood of Alpha
Draconis, the star of the pyramid, and in
about 25,800 years the North Star will have
been restored to its present prestige as the
apparent hub of the heavens.</p>

<p class='c008'>One curious irregularity in the motion
of the earth's poles must be mentioned in
connection with the precession of the equinoxes.
This is a kind of “nodding,” known
as nutation. It arises from variation in
the effect of the attraction of the sun and
the moon, due to the varying directions in
which the attraction is exercised. As far
as the sun is concerned, the precession is
slower near the time of the equinoxes than
in other parts of the year; in other words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>it is most rapid in mid-summer and mid-winter
when one or the other of the poles
is turned sunward. A similar, but much
larger, change takes place in the effect of the
moon's attraction owing to the inclination
of her orbit to the ecliptic. During about nine
and a half years, or half the period of revolution
of her nodes (see Part III, Section 4), the
moon tends to hasten the precession, and
during the next nine and a half years to
retard it. The general effect of the combination
of these irregularities is to cause the
earth's poles to describe a slightly waving
curve instead of a smooth circle round the
poles of the ecliptic. There are about
1400 of these “waves,” or “nods,” in the
motion of the poles in the course of their
26,000-year circuit. In accurate observation
the astronomer is compelled to take account
of the effects of nutation upon the apparent
places of the stars.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very remarkable general consequence
of the change in the direction of the earth's
axis will be mentioned when we come to
deal with the seasons.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>1. Nature, Shape, and Size of the Earth.</b>
The situation of the earth in the universe
has been briefly described in Part I; it
remains now to see what the earth is in itself,
and what are some of the principal phenomena
connected with it as a celestial body inhabited
by observant and reasoning beings.</p>

<p class='c008'>We know by ordinary experience that the
earth is composed of rock, sand, soil, etc.,
and generally covered, where there is no
running or standing water in the form of
rivers, lakes, or seas, with vegetation, such
as trees and grass. Further experience
teaches us that the earth is very large, and
that its surface is divided into wide areas
of land and of water. The largest bodies of
water, the oceans, taken all together, cover
about 72 per cent., or nearly three-quarters
of the entire surface of the earth. Investigations
carried as far down as we can go
show that the interior of the earth consists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of various kinds of rock, in which are contained
many different kinds of metals. While
there is reason for thinking that a high
degree of temperature prevails deep in the
earth, yet it appears evident, for other
reasons, that, taken as a whole, it is solid
and very rigid throughout. By methods,
the history and description of which we have
not here sufficient space to give, it has been
proved that the earth is, in form, a globe,
or more strictly an ellipsoid, slightly drawn
in at the poles and swollen round the equator.
The polar diameter is 7899 miles, and the
equatorial diameter 7926 miles, the difference
amounting to only 27 miles. Thus, for
ordinary purposes, we may regard the earth
as being a true sphere. The level of its
surface, however, is varied by hills and
mountains, which, though insignificant in
comparison with the size of the whole earth,
are enormous when compared with the
structures of human hands. The loftiest
known mountain on the earth, Mt. Everest
in the Himalayas, has an elevation of 29,000
feet above sea-level, and the deepest known
depression of the ocean bottom, near the
island of Guam in the Pacific, sinks 31,614
feet below sea-level. Thus, the apex of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>highest mountain is about eleven and a half
miles in vertical elevation above the bottom
of the deepest pit of the sea—a distance very
considerably less than half the difference
between the equatorial and polar diameters
of the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is believed that at the beginning of
its history the earth was a molten mass,
or perhaps a mass of hot gases and vapours
like the sun, and that it assumed its present
shape in obedience to mechanical laws, as
it cooled off. The rotation caused it to
swell round the equator and draw in at the
poles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The outer part of the earth is called its
crust, and geology shows that this has been
subject to violent changes, such as upheavals
and subsidences, and that in many places
sea and land have interchanged places,
probably more than once. Geology also
shows that the rocks of the earth's crust
are filled with the remains, or fossils, of
plants and animals differing from those now
existing, though related to them, and that
many of these must have lived millions of
years ago. Thus we see that the earth bears
marks of an immense antiquity, and that
it was probably inhabited during vast ages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>before the race of man had been developed.
The origin of life upon the earth is unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>2. The Attraction of Gravitation.</b> Among
the phenomena of life upon the earth, which
are so familiar that only thoughtful persons
see anything to wonder at in them, is what
we call the “weight” of bodies. Every
person feels that he is held down to the
ground by his weight, and he knows that if
he drops a heavy body it will fall straight
toward the ground. But what is this weight
which causes everything either to rest upon
the earth or to fall back to it if lifted up and
dropped? The answer to this question involves
a principle, or “law,” which affects
the whole universe, and makes it what we
see it. This principle is one of the great
foundation stones of astronomy. It is
called the law of gravitation, the word gravitation
being derived from the Latin <i>gravis</i>,
“heavy.” Briefly stated, the law is that
every body, or every particle of matter, attracts,
or strives to draw to itself, every other
body, or particle of matter. This force is called
the attraction of gravitation. A large body
possesses more attractive force than a
small one, in proportion to the mass, or
quantity of matter, that it contains. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>earth, being extremely large, holds all bodies
on its surface with a force proportionate
to its great mass. This explains why we
possess what we call weight, which is simply
the effect of the attraction of the earth upon
our bodies. A large body is heavier, or
drawn with more force by the earth, than a
small one (composed of the same kind of
matter), because it has a greater mass.
The body really attracts the earth as much
as the earth attracts the body, but the
amount of motion caused by the attraction
is proportional to the respective masses of
the attracting bodies, and since the mass of
the earth is almost infinitely great in comparison
with that of any body that we can
handle, the motion which the latter imparts
to the earth is imperceptible, and it is the
small body only that is seen to move under
the force of the attraction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now we are going to see how vastly
important in its effects is the fact that the
earth is spherical in form. Sir Isaac Newton,
who first worked out mathematically the
law of gravitation, proved that a spherical
body attracts, and is attracted, as if its
entire mass were concentrated in a point at
its centre. From this it follows that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>attraction of the earth is exercised just as if
the whole attractive force emanated from
a middle point, and, that being so, the effect
of the attraction is to draw bodies from all
sides toward the centre of the earth. This
explains why people on the opposite side of
the earth, or under our feet, as we say,
experience the same attractive force, or
have the same weight, that we do. All
round the earth, no matter where they may
be situated, objects are drawn toward the
centre. If at any point on the earth you
suspend a plumb-line, and then, going one
quarter way round, suspend another plumb-line,
each of the lines will be vertical at
the place where it hangs, and yet, the
directions of the two lines will be at right
angles to one another, since both point toward
the centre of the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Knowing the manner in which the earth
attracts, we have the means of determining
its entire mass, or, as it is sometimes called,
the weight of the earth. The principle
on which this is done is easily understood,
Suppose, for instance, that a small ball of
lead, of known weight, is brought near a
large ball, and delicately suspended in such
a way that, by microscopic observation, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>movement imparted by the attraction of
the large ball can be measured. The force
required to produce this movement can be
compared with the force of the earth's
attraction which produces the weight of
the ball, and thus the ratio of the mass
of the earth to that of the ball is determined.
The total mass of the earth has
been found to be equivalent to a “weight”
of about 6,500,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons.
The mean density of the earth compared with
that of water is found to be about 5½, that
is to say, the earth weighs 5½ times as much
as a globe of water of equal size.</p>

<p class='c008'>Newton did not stop with showing the
manner of the earth's attraction upon bodies
on or near its surface; he proved that the
earth attracted the moon also, and thus
retained it in its orbit. To understand this
we must notice another fact concerning
the manner in which gravitation acts. Its
force varies with distance. Experiment
followed by mathematical demonstration,
has proved that the variation of the attraction
is inversely proportional to the square
of the distance. This simply means that if
the distance between the two bodies concerned
is doubled, the force of attraction will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>be diminished four times, 4 being the square
of 2; and that if the distance is halved, the
force will be increased fourfold. Increase
the distance three times, and the force
diminishes nine times; diminish the distance
three times, and the force increases nine
times, because 9 is the square of 3, and, as
we have said, the force varies inversely,
or contrarily, to the change of distance.
Knowing this, Newton computed what the
force of the earth's attraction must be on
the moon, and he found that it was just
sufficient to keep the latter moving round
and round the earth. But why does not
the moon fall directly to the earth? Because
the moon had originally another motion
across the direction of the earth's attraction.
How it got this motion is a question into
which we cannot here enter, but, if it were
not attracted by the earth (or by the sun),
the moon would travel in a straight line
through space, like a stone escaping from a
sling. The force of the attraction is just
sufficient to make the moon move in an
orbital path about the earth.</p>
<div id='i075'  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
<img src='images/i075.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 5. How the Earth Controls the Moon.</i><br /><br />Let C be the centre of the earth and M that of the moon. Suppose the moon to be moving in a straight line at such a velocity that it will, if not interfered with, go to A in one day. Now suppose the attraction of the earth to act upon it. That attraction will draw it to M′. Again suppose that at M′ the moon were suddenly released from the earth's attraction; it would then shoot straight ahead to B in the course of the next day. But, in fact, the earth's attraction acts continually, and in the second day the moon is drawn to M″. In other words the moon is all the time falling away from the straight line that it would pursue but for the earth's attraction, and yet it does not get nearer the earth but simply travels in an endless curve round it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The same principle was extended by
Newton to explain the motion of the earth
around the sun. The force of the sun's
attraction, calculated in the same way,
can be shown to be just sufficient to retain
the earth in its orbit and prevent it from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>travelling away into space. And so with
all the other planets which revolve round
the sun. And this applies throughout the
universe. There are certain so-called double,
or binary, stars, which are so close together
that their attraction upon one another causes
them to revolve in orbits about their common
centre. In truth, all the stars attract the
earth and the sun, but the force of this
attraction is so slight on account of their
immense distance that we cannot observe
its effects. The reader who wishes to pursue
this subject of gravitational attraction should
consult more extensive works, such as Prof.
Young's <i>General Astronomy</i>, or Sir George
Airy's <i>Gravitation</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>3. The Tides.</b> The tides in the ocean
are a direct result of the attraction of gravitation.
They also involve in an interesting
way the principle that a spherical body, like
the earth, attracts and is attracted as if its
entire mass were concentrated at its centre.
The cause of the tides is the difference in
the attraction of the sun and moon upon the
body of the earth as a rigid sphere, and upon
the water of the oceans, as a fluid envelope
whose particles, while not free to escape from
the earth, are free to move, or slide, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>one another in obedience to varying forces.
The difference of the force of attraction
arises from the difference of distance. Since
the moon, because of her relative nearness,
is the chief agent in producing tides we shall,
at first, consider her tidal influence alone.
The diameter of the earth is, in round
numbers, 8000 miles; therefore, its radius
is 4000 miles. From this it follows that the
centre of the earth is 4000 miles farther from
the moon than that side of the earth which
is toward her at any time, and 4000 miles
nearer than the side which is away from her.
Consequently, her attraction must be stronger
upon the water of the ocean lying just under
her than upon the centre of the earth, and it
must also be stronger upon the centre of the
earth than upon the water of the ocean
lying upon the side which is farthest from
her. The result of these differences in the
force of the moon's attraction is that the
water directly under her tends away from
the centre of the earth, while, on the other
hand, the earth, considered as a solid sphere,
tends away from the water on the side opposite
to that where the moon is, and these
combined tendencies cause the water to
rise, with regard to its general level, in two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>protuberances, situated on opposite sides of
the earth. These we call tides.</p>

<div id='i079'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i079.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 6. The Tidal Force of the Moon.</i><br /><br />The solid earth is represented surrounded by a shell of water. The water on the side toward the moon is more attracted than the centre of the earth, C; the water on the opposite side is less attracted. The lines of force from the moon to the parts of the water lying toward A and B are inclined to the direct line between the centres of the earth and the moon, and the forces acting along these lines tend to draw the water in the directions shown by the arrow points. These are resultants of the horizontal and vertical components of the moon's attraction at the corresponding points on the earth, and the force acting along them tends to increase the weight of the water wherever the lines are inclined more toward the centre of the earth than toward the moon. On the side opposite the moon the same effects are produced in reverse, because on that side the general tendency is to draw the earth away from the water. Consequently if the earth did not rotate, and if it were surrounded with a complete shell of water, the latter would be drawn into an ellipsoidal shape, with the highest points under and opposite to the moon, and the lowest at the extremities of the diameter lying at right angles to the direction of<br />the moon.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some persons, when this statement is
made, inquire: “Why, then, does not the
moon take the water entirely away from the
earth?” The answer is, that the effect of
the tidal force is simply to diminish very
slightly the weight of the water, or its tendency
towards the earth's centre, but not
to destroy, or overmaster, the gravitational
control of the earth. The water retains
nearly all its weight, for the tidal force of
the moon diminishes it less than one part
in 8,000,000. Still, this slight diminution
is sufficient to cause the water to swell a
little above its general level, at the points
where it feels the effect of the tidal force.
On the other hand, around that part of the
earth which is situated half-way between the
two tides, or along a diameter at right angles
to the direction of the moon, the latter's
attraction <i>increases</i> the weight of the water,
<i>i. e.</i>, its tendency toward the earth's centre
(see Fig. 6). Perhaps this can better be
understood, if we imagine the earth to be
entirely liquid. In that case the difference
in the force of the moon's attraction with
difference of distance would be manifested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>in varying degrees throughout the earth's
whole frame, and the result would be to draw
the watery globe out into an ellipsoidal
figure, having its greatest diameter in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>line of the moon's attraction, and its smallest
diameter at right angles to that line. The
proportions of the ellipsoid would be such
that the forces would be in equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Owing to a variety of causes, such as the
rotation of the earth on its axis, which carries
the water rapidly round with it; the inertia
of the water, preventing it from instantly
responding to the tidal force; the irregular
shape of the oceans, interrupted on all sides
by great areas of land; their varying depth,
producing differences of friction, and so on,
the tidal waves do not appear directly under,
or directly opposite to, the moon, and the
calculation of the course and height of the
actual tides, at particular points on the earth,
becomes one of the most difficult problems in
astronomical physics.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now turn to consider the effects of the
sun's tidal force in connection with that of
the moon. This introduces further complications.
The solar tides are only about
two-fifths as high as the lunar tides, but they
suffice to produce notable effects when they
are either combined with, or act in opposition
to, the others. They are combined twice a
month—once when the moon is between the
earth and the sun, at the time of new moon;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and again when the moon is in opposition
to the sun, at the time of full moon. In
these two positions the attractions of the sun
and the moon must, so to speak, act together,
with the result that the tides produced by
them blend into a single greater wave. This
combination produces what are called spring
tides, the highest of the month. When, on
the other hand, the moon is in a position at
right angles to the direction of the sun,
which happens at the lunar phases named
first and last quarters, the solar and the
lunar tides have their crests 90° apart,
and, in a sense, act against one another,
and then we have the neap tides, which are
the lowest of the month.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without entering into a demonstration,
it may here be stated as a fact to be memorised,
that the tidal force exerted by any
celestial body varies inversely as the <i>cube</i>
of the distance. This is the reason why the
sun, although it exceeds the moon in mass
more than 25,000,000 times, and is situated
only about 400 times as far away from the
earth, exercises comparatively so slight a
tidal force on the water of the ocean. If the
tidal force varied as the <i>square</i> of the distance,
like the ordinary effects of gravitation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the tides produced by the sun would be more
than 150 times as high as those produced
by the moon, and would sweep New York,
London, and all the seaports of the world
to destruction. In that case it might be
possible, by delicate observations, to detect
a tidal effect produced upon the oceans of
the earth by the planet Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>4. The Atmosphere.</b> The solid globe of
the earth is enveloped in a mixture of gases,
principally oxygen and nitrogen, which we
call the air, or the atmosphere, and upon
whose presence our life and most other
forms of life depend. The atmosphere
is retained by the attraction of the earth,
and it rotates together with the earth.
If this were not so—if the atmosphere
stood fast while the earth continued to spin
within it—a terrific wind would constantly
blow from the east, having a velocity at the
equator of more than a thousand miles an
hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exactly how high the atmosphere extends
we do not know—it may not have any
definite limits—but we do know that its
density rapidly diminishes with increase
of height above the ground, so that above
an elevation of a few miles it becomes so rare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>that it would not support human life. The
phenomena of meteors, set afire by the friction
of their swift rush through the upper
air, prove, however, that there is a perceptible
atmosphere at an elevation of more than a
hundred miles.</p>

<p class='c008'>From an astronomical point of view, the
most important effect of the presence of the
atmosphere is its power of refracting light.
By refraction is meant the property possessed
by every transparent medium of bending,
under particular circumstances, the rays of
light which enter it out of their original
course. The science of physics teaches us
that if a ray of light passes from any transparent
medium into another which is denser,
and if the path of this ray is not perpendicular
to the surface of the second medium,
it will be turned from its original course
in such a way as to make it more nearly
perpendicular. Thus, if a ray of light passes
from air into water at a certain slope to the
surface, it will, upon entering the water,
be so changed in direction that the slope
will become steeper. Only if it falls perpendicularly
upon the water will it continue
on without change of direction. Conversely
a ray passing from a denser into a rarer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>medium is bent away from a perpendicular
to the surface of the first medium, or its
slope becomes less. This explains why, if
we put a coin in a bowl, with the eye in such
a position that it cannot see the coin over
the edge, and then fill the bowl with water,
the coin seems to be lifted up into sight.
Moreover, if any transparent medium increases
in density with depth, the amount
of refraction will increase as the ray goes
deeper, and the direction of the ray will be
changed from a straight line into a curve,
tending to become more and more perpendicular.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now all this applies to the atmosphere.
If a star is seen in the zenith, its light falls
perpendicularly into the atmosphere and
its course is not deviated, or in other words
there is no refraction. But if the star is
somewhere between the zenith and the
horizon, its light falls slopingly into the
atmosphere, and is subject to refraction,
the amount of bending increasing with
approach to the horizon. Observation shows
that the refraction of the atmosphere, which
is zero at the zenith, increases to about half
a degree (and sometimes much more, depending
upon the state of the air), near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>horizon. It follows that a celestial object
seen near the horizon will ordinarily appear
about half a degree above its true place.
Since the apparent diameters of the sun
and the moon are about half a degree, when
they are rising or setting they can be seen
on the horizon before they have really risen
above it, or after they have really sunk
below it. Tables of refraction at various
altitudes have been prepared, and they have
to be consulted in all exact observations of
the celestial bodies.</p>

<div id='i085'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i085.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 7. Refraction.</i><br /><br />Suppose an observer situated at O on the earth. The sun, at S, has sunk below the level of his horizon, O H, but since the sun sends out rays in all directions there will be some, such as S A B, which will strike the atmosphere at A, and the refraction, tending to make the ray more nearly perpendicular to the surface of the atmosphere, will, instead of allowing it to go on straight over the observer's head to B, bend it down along the dotted line A O, and the observer will see the sun as if it lay in the direction of the dotted line O A S′, which places the sun apparently above the horizon.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><b>5. Dip of the Horizon.</b> Another correction
which has to be applied in many
observations depends upon the sphericity
of the earth. We have described the rational
horizon, and pointed out how it differs from
the sensible horizon. We have also said
that at sea the sensible horizon nearly
accords with the rational horizon (see
Part I, Sect. 3). But the accord is not
complete, owing to what is called the dip
of the horizon. In fact, the sea horizon lies
below the rational horizon by an amount
varying with the elevation of the eye above
the surface. Geometry enables us to determine
just what the dip of the horizon must
be for any given elevation of the eye. A
rough and ready rule, which may serve for
many purposes, is that the square root of
the elevation of the eye in feet equals the
dip of the horizon in minutes of arc, or of
angular measure. The reader will readily
see that the dip of the horizon is a necessary
consequence of the rotundity of the earth.
It is because of this that, as a ship recedes
at sea her hull first disappears below the
horizon, and then her lower sails, and finally
her top-sails. The use of a telescope does
not help the matter, because a telescope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>only <i>sees straight</i>, and cannot bend the
line of sight over the rim of the horizon.
Atmospheric refraction, however, enables us
to see an object which would be hidden by
the horizon if there were no air. In navigation,
which, as a science, is an outgrowth
of astronomy, these things have to be carefully
taken into account.</p>

The observer at the elevation B has a sensible horizon still more inclined and he sees as far as b. If the observation were made from an immense height the observer would see practically half round the earth<br />just as we see half round the globe of the moon.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span><b>6. Aberration.</b> A few words must be said
about the phenomenon known as aberration
of light. This is an apparent displacement
of a celestial object due to the motion of
the earth in its orbit. It is customary to
illustrate it by imagining oneself to be in a
shower of rain, whose drops are falling
vertically. In such a case, if a person
stands fast the rain will descend perpendicularly
upon his head, but if he advances
rapidly in any direction he will feel the drops
striking him in the face, because his own
forward motion is compounded with the
downward motion of the rain so that the
latter seems to be descending slantingly
toward him. The same thing happens with
the light falling from the stars. As the
earth advances in its orbit it seems to meet
the light rays, and they appear to come from
a direction ahead of the flying earth. The
result is that, since we see a star in the
direction from which its light seems to come,
the star appears in <i>advance</i> of its real
position, or of the position in which we
would see it if the earth stood fast. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>amount by which the position of a star
is shifted by aberration depends upon the
ratio of the earth's velocity to the velocity
of light. In round numbers this ratio is as
1 to 10,000. The motion of the earth being
in a slightly eccentric ellipse, the stars
describe corresponding, but very tiny, ellipses
once every year upon the background of the
sky. But the precise shape of the ellipse
depends upon the position of the star on
the celestial sphere. If it is near one of the
poles of the ecliptic, it will describe an
annual ellipse which will be almost a circle,
its greater diameter being 41″ of arc. If it
is near the plane of the ecliptic, it will
describe a very eccentric ellipse, but the
greater diameter will always be 41″, although
the shorter diameter may be immeasurably
small. The effects of aberration have to
be allowed for in all careful astronomical
observation either of the sun or the stars.
This is done by reducing the apparent
place of the object to the place it would have
if it were seen at the centre of its annual
ellipse.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>7. Time.</b> Without astronomical observations
we could have no accurate knowledge
of time. The basis of the measurement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>time is furnished by the rotation of the earth
on its axis. We divide the period which the
earth occupies in making one complete
turn into twenty-four equal parts, or hours.
The ascertainment of this period, called a
day, depends upon observations of the stars.
Suppose we see a certain star exactly on the
meridian at some moment; just twenty-four
hours later that star will have gone entirely
round the sky, and will again appear on the
meridian. The revolving heavens constitute
the great clock of clocks, by whose movements
all other clocks are regulated. We know
that it is not the heavens which revolve,
but the earth which rotates, but for convenience
we accept the appearance as a substitute
for the fact. The rotation of the earth is
so regular that no measurable variation has
been found in two thousand years. We have
reasons for thinking that there must be a
very slow and gradual retardation, owing
principally to the braking action of the tides,
but it is so slight that we cannot detect
it with any means at present within our
command.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Part I it was shown how the passage
across the meridian of the point in the sky
called the vernal equinox serves to indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the beginning of the astronomical “day,”
but the position of the vernal equinox itself
has to be determined by observations on the
stars. By means of a telescope, so mounted
that it can only move up or down, round a
horizontal axis, and with the axis pointing
exactly east and west so that the up and down
movements of the telescope tube follow the
line of the meridian, the moment of passage
across the meridian of a star at any altitude
can be observed. Observations of this nature
are continually made at all great government
observatories, such as the observatory at
Washington or that at Greenwich, and at
many others, and by their means clocks and
chronometers are corrected, and a standard
of time is furnished to the whole world.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are, however, three different ways
of reckoning time, or, as it is usually said,
three kinds of time. One is sidereal time,
which is indicated by the passage of stars
across the meridian, and which measures the
true period of the earth's rotation; another
is apparent solar time, which is indicated by
the passage of the sun across the meridian;
and a third is mean solar time, which is
indicated by a carefully regulated clock,
whose errors are corrected by star observations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>This last kind of time is that
which is universally used in ordinary life
(the use of sidereal time being confined to
astronomy), so it is necessary to explain
what it is and how it differs from apparent
solar time.</p>

<div id='i093'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i093.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 9. Sidereal and Solar Time.</i><br /><br />C is the centre of the earth, and O the place of an observer on the earth's surface.<br /><br />Suppose the sun at A to be in conjunction with the star S. Then, at the end of twenty-four sidereal hours, when the earth has made one turn on its axis and the place O has again come into conjunction with the star, the sun, in consequence of its yearly motion in the ecliptic, will have advanced to B, and the earth will have to turn through the angle A C B before O will overtake the sun and complete a solar day; wherefore the solar day is longer than the sidereal.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the first place, the reason why sidereal
time is not universally and exclusively used
is because, although it measures the true
period of the earth's rotation by the apparent
motion of the stars, it does not exactly accord
with the apparent motion of the sun; and,
naturally, the sun, since it is the source of
light for the earth, and the cause of the difference
between day and night, is taken
for all ordinary purposes, as the standard
indicator of the progress of the hours. The
fact that it is mid-day, or noon, at any place
when the sun crosses the meridian of that
place, is a fact of common knowledge, which
cannot be ignored. On the other hand, the
vernal equinox, which is the “noon mark”
for sidereal time, is independent of the
alternation of day and night, and may be
on the meridian as well at midnight as at
mid-day. Before clocks and watches were
perfected, the moment of the sun's passage
over the meridian was determined by means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>of a gnomon, which shows the instant of
noon by the length of a shadow cast by an
upright rod. Since the apparent course of
the sun through the sky is a curve, rising
from the eastern horizon, attaining its greatest
elevation where it meets the meridian,
and thence declining to the western horizon,
it is evident that the length of the shadow
must be least when the sun is on the meridian,
or at its maximum altitude. The gnomon,
or the sun-dial, gives us apparent solar time.
But this differs from sidereal time because,
as we saw in Part I, the sun, in consequence
of the earth's motion round it, moves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>about one degree eastward every twenty-four
hours, and, since one degree is equal to
four minutes of time, the sun rises about four
minutes later, with reference to the stars,
every morning. Consequently it comes four
minutes later to the meridian day after day.
Or, to put it in another way, suppose that
the sun and a certain star are upon the
meridian at the same instant. The star is
fixed in its place in the sky, but the sun is
not fixed; on the contrary it moves about one
degree eastward (the same direction as that
of the earth's rotation) in twenty-four hours.
Then, when the rotation of the earth has
brought the star back to the meridian at the
end of twenty-four sidereal hours, the sun,
in consequence of its motion, will still be one
degree east of the meridian, and the earth
must turn through the space of another
degree, which will take four minutes, before
it can have the sun again upon the meridian.
The true distance moved by the sun in
twenty-four hours is a little less than one
degree, and the exact time required for the
meridian to overtake it is 3 min. 56.555 sec.
Thus, the sidereal day (period of 24 hours)
is nearly four minutes shorter than the solar
day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>It would seem, then, that by taking the
sun for a guide, and dividing the period
between two of its successive passages over
the meridian into twenty-four hours, we
should have a perfect measure of time,
without regard to the stars; in other words,
that apparent solar time would be entirely
satisfactory for ordinary use. But, unfortunately,
the apparent eastward motion of
the sun is not regular. It is sometimes
greater than the average and sometimes less.
This variation is due almost entirely: first,
to the fact that its orbit not being a perfect
circle the earth moves faster when it is
near perihelion, and slower when it is near
aphelion; and, second, to the effects of the
inclination of the ecliptic to the equator.
In consequence, another measure of solar
time is used, called <i>mean</i> solar time, in which,
by imagining a fictitious sun, moving with
perfect regularity through the ecliptic, the
discrepancies are avoided. All ordinary
clocks are set to follow this fictitious, or
mean, sun. The result is that clock time
does not agree exactly with sun-dial time,
or, what is the same thing, apparent solar
time. The clock is ahead of the real sun
at some times of the year, and behind it at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>other times. This difference is called the
equation of time. Four times in the year
the equation is zero, <i>i.e.</i>, there is no difference
between the clock and the sun. These
times are April 15, June 14, Sept. 1, and
Dec. 24. At four other times of the year
the difference is at a maximum, viz. Feb. 11,
sun 14 min. 27 sec. behind clock; May 14,
sun 3 min. 49 sec. ahead of clock; July 26,
sun 6 min. 16 sec. behind clock; Nov. 2,
sun 16 min. 18 sec. ahead of clock. These
dates and differences vary very slightly
from year to year.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, whatever measures of time we may
use, it is observation of the stars that furnishes
the means of correcting them.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>8. Day and Night.</b> The period of twenty-four
hours required for one turn of the earth
on its axis is called a day, and in astronomical
reckoning it is treated as an undivided whole,
the hours being counted uninterruptedly
from 0 to 24; but nature has divided the
period into two very distinct portions, one
characterised by the presence and the other
by the absence of the sun. Popularly we
speak of the sunlighted portion as day and
of the other as night, and there are no two
associated phenomena in nature more completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in contrast one to the other. The
cause of the contrast between day and night
must have been evident to the earliest human
beings who were capable of any thought at
all. They saw that day inevitably began
whenever the sun rose above the horizon,
and as inevitably ceased whenever it sank
beneath it. In all literatures, imaginative
writers have pictured the despair of primeval
man when he first saw the sun disappear
and night come on, and his joy when he first
beheld the sun rise, bringing day back with
it. Even his uninstructed mind could not
have been in doubt about the causal connection
of the sun with daylight.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now know that the cause of the alternate
rising and setting of the sun, and of its
apparent motion through the sky, is the
rotation of the earth. Making in our minds
a picture of the earth as a turning globe
exposed to the sunbeams, we are able to see
that one half of it must necessarily be illuminated,
while the other half is in darkness.
We also see that its rotation causes these
two halves gradually to interchange places
so that daylight progresses completely round
the earth once in the course of twenty-four
hours. If the earth were not surrounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>by an atmosphere, exactly one half of it
would lie in the sunlight and exactly one
half in darkness, but the atmosphere causes
the illuminated part slightly to exceed the
unilluminated part. The reason for this is
twofold: first, because the atmosphere, being
transparent and extending to a considerable
height above the solid globe, receives rays
from the sun after the latter has sunk below
the horizon, and these rays cause a faint illumination
in the sky after the sun as viewed
from the surface of the ground has disappeared;
and, second, because the air has the
property of refracting the rays of light,
in consequence of which the sun appears
above the horizon both a little time before
it has actually risen and a little time after
it has actually set. The faint illumination
at the beginning and the end of the day
is called twilight. Its cause is the reflection
of light from the air at a considerable elevation
above the ground. Observation
shows that evening twilight lasts until the
sun has sunk about 18° below the western
horizon, while morning twilight begins
when the sun is still 18° below the nearest
horizon. The length of time occupied by
twilight, or its duration, depends upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>observer's place on the earth and increases
with distance from the equator. The length
of twilight at any particular place also varies
with the seasons.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will probably have occurred to the reader
that, since day and night are ceaselessly
chasing each other round the globe, it must
be necessary to choose some point of beginning,
in order to keep the regular succession
of the days of the week. The necessity for
this is evident as soon as we reflect that
what is sunrise at one place on the earth,
is sunset for a place situated half-way round,
on the other side. To understand this it
will be better, perhaps, to consider the phenomena
of noon at various places. It is
noon at any place when the sun is on the
meridian of that place. But we have seen
that every place has its own meridian;
consequently, since the sun cannot be on
the meridian of more than one place at a
time, each different place (reckoning east
and west, for, of course, all places lying
exactly north or south of one another have
the same meridian), must have its own local
noontime. Since the sun appears to move
round the earth from east to west, it will
arrive at the meridian of a place lying east
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of us sooner than at our meridian, and it
will arrive at our meridian sooner than at
that of a place lying west of us. Thus, when
it is noon at Greenwich, it is about 7 o'clock
<span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, or five hours before noon, at New
York, because the angular distance westward
round the earth's surface from Greenwich
to New York is, in round numbers, 75°,
which corresponds with five hours of time,
there being 150 to every hour. At the same
moment it will be 5 o'clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, or five
hours after noon, at Cashmere, because
Cashmere lies 75° east of Greenwich. That
is to say, the sun crosses the meridian of
Cashmere five hours before it reaches the
meridian of Greenwich, and it crosses the
meridian of Greenwich five hours before it
reaches that of New York. At a place
half-way round the circumference of the
globe, <i>i.e.</i> 180° either east or west of
Greenwich, it will be midnight at the same
instant when it will be mid-day, or noon,
at Greenwich. Now let us consider this
for a moment.</p>

<div id='i101'  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
<img src='images/i101.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The arrows show the direction in which the earth turns (from west to east). It is always noon at the place which is directly under the sun. Call it Sunday noon at Greenwich, at the top of the circle; then it is 10 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> Sunday at a point 30° west and 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Sunday at a point 30° east, and so on. Exactly opposite to the noon point it is midnight. By common consent we change the name of the day, and the date, at midnight; consequently it is Sunday midnight just east of the vertical line at the bottom of the circle and Monday morning just west of it. If we cross that line going westward we shall pass directly from Sunday to Monday, and if we cross it going eastward we shall pass directly from Monday to Sunday. Since, by convention, this is a fixed line on the earth's surface, the same change will take place no matter what the hour of the day may be.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is customary to change the name of
the day at midnight. Thus at the stroke
of midnight, anywhere, Sunday gives place
to Monday. Suppose, then, that the day
when we see the sun on the meridian at
Greenwich happens to be Sunday. Sunday
will then be, so to speak, twelve hours old
at Greenwich, because it began there at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the preceding midnight. Sunday will be
only seven hours old at New York, where
it also began at the preceding midnight.
In California, 45°, or three hours, still farther
west than New York, Sunday will be only
four hours old, since the local time there
is only four hours after midnight. Go on
over the Pacific Ocean, until we arrive at
a point 180°, or twelve hours, west of Greenwich.
There, evidently, Sunday will just
have been born, the preceding day, Saturday,
having expired at the stroke of midnight.
Now if we just step over that line of 180°
in what day shall we be? It cannot be
Sunday, because Sunday has just begun on
the line itself. It cannot be Saturday,
because that would be counting backward.
Evidently it can be no other than Monday.
Let us examine this a little more closely.
It is Sunday noon at Greenwich. We now
go round the earth eastward instead of
westward. At 90°, or six hours, east of
Greenwich, we find that it is 6 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Sunday
and at 180°, or twelve hours, east of
Greenwich we find that it is Sunday midnight,
or in other words Monday morning. But
the line of 180° <i>east</i> of Greenwich coincides
with the line of 180° <i>west</i> of Greenwich,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>which we formerly approached from the
opposite direction. So we see that we were
right in concluding that in stepping over that
line from the east to the west side, we were
passing from Sunday into Monday. It is
on that line that each day vanishes and its
successor takes its place. It is the “date-line”
for the whole earth, chosen by the
common consent of every civilised nation,
just as we have seen that the meridian of
Greenwich is the common reference line for
reckoning longitude. It lies entirely in the
Pacific Ocean, hardly touching any island,
and it was chosen for this very reason,
because if it ran over inhabited lands, like
Europe or America, it would cause endless
confusion. Situated as it is, it causes no
trouble except to sea captains, and very
little to them. If a ship crosses the line
going westward the captain jumps his log-book
one day forward. If it is, for instance,
Wednesday noon, east of the line he calls it
Thursday noon, as soon as he has passed over.
If he is going eastward he drops back a day
on crossing the line, as from Thursday noon
to Wednesday noon. The date-line theoretically
follows the 180th meridian, but, in
fact, in order to avoid certain groups of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>islands, it bends about a little, while keeping
its general direction from north to south.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>9. The Seasons.</b> We now recall again
what was said in Part I, about the inclination
of the ecliptic, or the apparent path of the
sun in the heavens, to the equator. Because
of this inclination, the sun appears half the
year above the equator and the other half
below it. When it is above the equator
for people living in the northern hemisphere,
it is below the equator for those living
in the southern hemisphere, and <i>vice versa</i>.
This is because observers on opposite sides
of the plane of the equator look at it from
opposite points of view. For the northern
observer the celestial equator appears south
of the zenith; for the southern observer it
appears north of the zenith, its distance
from the zenith, in both cases, increasing
with the observer's distance from the equator
of the earth. If he is on the earth's equator,
the celestial equator passes directly <i>through</i>
the zenith. For convenience we shall suppose
the observer to be somewhere in the
northern hemisphere.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Let us begin with that time of the year
when the sun arrives at the vernal equinox.
This occurs about the 21st of March. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>sun is then perpendicular over the equator,
daylight extends, uninterrupted, from pole
to pole, and day and night (neglecting the
effects of twilight and refraction) are of
equal length all over the earth. Everywhere
there are about twelve hours of daylight
and twelve hours of darkness. This is the
beginning of the astronomical spring. As
time goes on, the motion of the sun in the
ecliptic carries it eastward from the vernal
equinox, and, at the same time, owing to the
inclination of the ecliptic, it rises gradually
higher above the equator, increasing its
northern declination slowly, day after day.
Immediately the equality of day and night
ceases, and in the northern hemisphere
the day becomes gradually longer in duration
than the night, while in the southern hemisphere
it becomes shorter. Moreover, because
the sun is now north of the equator,
daylight no longer extends from pole to pole
on the earth, but the south pole is in continual
darkness, while the north pole is illuminated.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>You can illustrate this, and explain to
yourself why the relative length of day and
night changes, and why the sun leaves one
pole in darkness while rising higher over the
other, by suspending a small terrestrial
globe with its axis inclined about 23½° from
the perpendicular, and passing a lamp
around it in a horizontal plane. At two
points only in its circuit will the lamp be
directly over the equator of the globe. Call
one of these points the vernal equinox.
You will then see that, when the lamp is
directly over this point, its light illuminates
the globe from pole to pole, but when it has
passed round so as to be at a point higher
than the equator, its light no longer reaches
the lower pole, although it passes over the
upper one.</p>
<div id='i107'  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
<img src='images/i107.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 11. The Seasons.</i><br /><br />The earth is represented at four successive points in its orbit about the sun. Since the axis of the earth is virtually unchangeable in its direction in space (leaving out of account the slow effects of the precession of the equinoxes), it results that at one time of the year, the north pole is inclined toward the sun and at the opposite time of the year away from it. It attains its greatest inclination sunward at the summer solstice, then the line between day and night lies 23½° beyond the north pole, so that the whole area within the arctic circle is in perpetual daylight. The days are longer than the nights throughout the northern hemisphere, but the day becomes longer in proportion to the night as the arctic circle is approached, and beyond that the sun is continually above the horizon. In the southern hemisphere exactly the reverse occurs. When the earth has advanced to the autumn equinox, the axis is inclined neither toward nor away from the sun. The latter is then perpendicular over the equator and day and night are of equal length all over the earth. When the earth reaches the winter solstice the north pole is inclined away from the sun, and now it is summer in the southern hemisphere. At the vernal equinox again there is no inclination of the axis either toward or away from the sun, and once more day and night are everywhere equal. A little study of this diagram will show why on the equator day and night are always of equal length.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now, with the lamp thus elevated above
the equator, set the globe in rotation about
its axis. You will perceive that all points
in the upper hemisphere are longer in light
than in darkness, because the plane dividing
the illuminated and the unilluminated halves
of the globe is inclined to the globe's axis
in such a way that it lies beyond the upper
pole as seen from the direction of the lamp.
Consequently, the upper half of the globe
above the equator, as it goes round, has more
of its surface illuminated than unilluminated,
and, as it turns on its axis, any point in
that upper half, moving round parallel to
the equator, is longer in light than in darkness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>You will also observe that the ratio
of length of the light to the darkness is
greater the nearer the point lies to the pole,
and that when it is within a certain distance
of the pole, corresponding with the
elevation of the lamp above the equator,
it lies in continual light—in other words,
within that distance from the pole night
vanishes and daylight is unceasing. At the
same time you will perceive that round the
lower pole there is a similar space within
which day has vanished and night is unceasing,
and that in the whole of the lower
hemisphere night is longer than day. Exactly
on the equator, day and night are always of
equal length.</p>

<p class='c008'>Endeavour to represent all this clearly to
your imagination, before actually trying
the experiment, or consulting a diagram.
If you try the experiment you may, instead
of setting the axis of the globe at a slant,
place it upright, and then gradually raise
and lower the lamp as it is carried round the
globe, now above and now below the equator.</p>

<p class='c008'>We return to our description of the actual
movements of the sun. As it rises higher
from the equator, not only does the day
increase in length relatively to the night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>but the rays of sunlight descend more nearly
perpendicular upon the northern hemisphere.
The consequence is that their heating effect
upon the ground and the atmosphere increases
and the temperature rises until, when the
sun reaches its greatest northern declination,
about the 22d of June (when it is 23½°
north of the equator), the astronomical
summer begins. This point in the sun's
course through the circle of the ecliptic
is called the summer solstice (see Part I,
Sect. 8). Having passed the solstice, the
sun begins to decline again toward the equator.
For a short time the declination
diminishes slowly because the course of the
ecliptic close to the solstice is nearly parallel
to the equator, and in the meantime the
temperature in the northern hemisphere
continues to increase, the amount of heat
radiated away during the night being less
than that received from the sun during the
day. This condition continues for about six
weeks, the greatest heats of summer falling
at the end of July or the beginning of August,
when the sun has already declined far toward
the equator, and the nights have begun
notably to lengthen. But the accumulation
of heat during the earlier part of the summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>is sufficient to counterbalance the loss caused
by the declension of the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the 23d of September the sun
again crosses the equator, this time at the
autumnal equinox, the beginning of the
astronomical autumn, and after that it
sinks lower and lower (while appearing
to rise in the southern hemisphere), until
about the 22d of December, when it reaches
its greatest southern declination, 23½°, at
the winter solstice, which marks the beginning
of the astronomical winter. It is
hardly necessary to point out that the southern
winter corresponds in time with the
northern summer, and <i>vice versa</i>. From
the winter solstice the sun turns northward
once more, reaching the vernal equinox
again on the 21st of March.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus we see that we owe the succession
of the seasons entirely to the inclination
of the earth's axis out of a perpendicular to
the plane of the ecliptic. If there were no
such inclination there would be climate but
no seasons. There would be no summer
heat, except in the neighbourhood of the
equator, while the middle latitudes would
have a moderate temperature the year round.
Owing to the effects of refraction, perpetual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>day would prevail within a small region
round each of the poles. The sun would be
always perpendicular over the equator.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two things remain to be pointed out with
regard to the effect of the sun's annual motion
in the ecliptic. One of these is the circles
called the tropics. These are drawn round
the earth parallel to the equator and at a
distance of 23½° from it, one in the northern
and the other in the southern hemisphere.
The northern one is called the tropic of
Cancer, because its corresponding circle
on the celestial sphere runs through the
zodiacal sign Cancer, and the southern one
is called the tropic of Capricorn for a similar
reason. The tropics run through the two
solstices, and mark the apparent <i>daily</i> track
of the sun in the sky when it is at either its
greatest northern or its greatest southern
declination. The sun is then perpendicular
over one or the other of the tropics. That
part of the earth lying between the tropics
is called the torrid zone, because the sun is
always not far from perpendicular over it,
and the heat is very great.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The other thing to be mentioned is the
polar circles. These are situated 23½°
from each pole, just as the tropics are situated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>a similar distance on each side of the equator.
The northern is called the arctic, and the
southern the antarctic circle. Those parts
of the earth which lie between the tropics
and the polar circles are called respectively
the northern and the southern temperate
zone. The polar circles mark the limits of
the region round each pole where the sun
shines continuously when it is at one or the
other of the solstices. If the reader will
recall the experiment with the globe and the
lamp, he will perceive that these circles
correspond with the borders of the circular
spaces at each pole of the globe which are
alternately carried into and out of the full
light as the lamp is elevated to its greatest
height above the equator or depressed to its
greatest distance below it. At each pole,
in turn, there are six months of continual
day followed by six months of continual
night, and when the sun is at one of the
solstices it just touches the horizon on the
corresponding polar circle at the hour that
marks midnight on the parts of the earth
which lie outside the polar circles. This
is the celebrated phenomenon of the “midnight
sun.” At any point within the polar
circle concerned, the sun, at the hour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>midnight approaches the horizon but does
not touch it, its midnight elevation increasing
with nearness to the pole, while
exactly at the pole itself the sun simply moves
round the sky once in twenty-four hours
in a circle practically parallel to the horizon.
It is by observations on the daily movement
of the sun that an explorer seeking one of
the earth's poles during the long polar day
is able to determine when he has actually
reached his goal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reader will have remarked in these
descriptions how frequently the angle of
23½° turns up, and he should remember that
it is, in every case, due to the same cause,
viz., the inclination of the earth's axis from
a perpendicular to the ecliptic.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very remarkable fact must now be
referred to. Although the <i>angular distance</i>
that the sun has to travel in passing first from
the vernal equinox to the autumnal equinox,
on the northern side of the equator, and then
back again from the autumnal equinox to
the vernal equinox, on the southern side of
the equator, is the same, the <i>time</i> that it
occupies in making these two half stages
in its annual journey is <i>not</i> the same.
Beginning from the 21st of March and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>counting the number of days to the 23d
of September, and then beginning from the
23d of September and counting the number
of days to the next 21st of March, you will
find that in an ordinary year the first
period is seven days longer than the second.
In other words, the sun is a week longer
above the equator than below it. The
reason for this difference is found in the fact
that the orbit of the earth about the sun is
not a perfect circle, but is a slightly elongated
ellipse, and the sun, instead of being situated
in the centre, is situated in one of the two
foci of the ellipse, 3,000,000 miles nearer to
one end of it than to the other. Now this
elliptical orbit of the earth is so situated
that the earth is nearest to the focus occupied
by the sun, or in perihelion, about December
31st, only a few days after the winter solstice,
and farthest from the sun, or in aphelion,
about July 1st, only a few days after the
summer solstice. Thus the earth is nearer
the sun during the winter half of the year,
when the sun appears south of the equator,
than during the summer half of the year,
when the sun appears north of the equator.
Now the law of gravitation teaches that
when the earth is nearer the sun it must move
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>more rapidly in its orbit than when it is
more distant, from which it follows that the
time occupied by the sun in its apparent
passage from the vernal equinox to the autumnal
equinox is longer than that occupied
in the passage back from the autumnal to
the vernal equinox.</p>

<p class='c008'>But while the summer half of the year
is longer than the winter half in the northern
hemisphere, the reverse is the case in the
southern hemisphere. There the winter is
longer than the summer. Moreover, the
winter of the southern hemisphere occurs
when the earth is farthest from the sun,
which accentuates the disadvantage. It has
been thought that the greater quantity of
ice about the south pole may be due to this
increased length and severity of the southern
winter. It is true that the southern summer,
although shorter, is hotter than the northern,
but while, theoretically, this should restore
the balance as a whole, yet it would appear
that the short hot summer does not, in fact,
suffice to arrest the accumulation of ice.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, the present condition of things
as between the two hemispheres will not
continue, but in the course of time will be
reversed. The reader will recall that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>precession of the equinoxes causes the axis
of the earth to turn slowly round in space.
At present the northern end of the earth's
axis is inclined away from the aphelion and
in the direction of the perihelion point of the
orbit, so that the northern summer occurs
when the earth is in the more distant part
of its orbit, and the winter when it is in the
nearer part. But the precession swings the
axis round <i>westward</i> from its present position
at the rate of 50″.2 per year, while at the
same time the position of the orbit itself
is shifted (by the effects of the attraction
of the planets) in such a manner that the
aphelion and perihelion points, which are
called the apsides, move round <i>eastward</i>
at the rate of 11″.25 per year. The combination
of the precession with the motion of
the apsides produces a revolution at the rate
of 61″.45 per year, which in the course of
10,500 years will completely reverse the
existing inclination of the axis with regard
to the major diameter of the orbit, so that
then the northern hemisphere will have its
summer when the earth is near perihelion
and its winter when it is near aphelion.
The winter, then, will, for us, be long and
severe and the summer short though hot.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>It has been thought possible that such a
state of things may cause, in our hemisphere,
a partial renewal of what is known in geology
as a glacial period. A glacial period in the
southern hemisphere would probably always
be less severe than in the northern, because
of the great preponderance of sea over land
in the southern half of the globe. An ocean
climate is more equable than a land climate.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>10. The Year, the Calendar, and the
Month.</b> A year is the period of time required
for the earth to make one revolution in its
orbit about the sun. But, as there are
three kinds, or measures, of time, so there are
three kinds, or measures, of the year. The
first of these is called the sidereal year, but
although, like sidereal time, it measures the
true length of the period in question, it is
not suitable for ordinary use. To understand
what is meant by a sidereal year, imagine
yourself to be looking at the earth from the
sun, and suppose that at some instant you
should see the earth exactly in conjunction
with a star. When, having gone round the
sun, it had come back again to conjunction
with the same star, precisely one revolution
would have been performed in its orbit,
and the period elapsed would be a sidereal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>year. Practically, the length of the sidereal
year is determined by observing when the
sun, in its apparent annual journey round
the sky, has come back to conjunction with
some given star.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second kind of year is called the tropical
year, and it is measured by the period
taken by the sun to pass round the sky from
one conjunction with the vernal equinox to
the next. This period differs slightly from the
first, because, owing to the precession of the
equinoxes, the vernal equinox is slowly
shifting westward, as if to meet the sun in its
annual course, from which it results that the
sun overtakes the equinox a little before
it has completed a sidereal year. The
tropical year is about twenty minutes shorter
than the sidereal year. It is, however,
more convenient for ordinary purposes,
because we naturally refer the progress of
the year to that of the seasons, and, as we
have seen, the seasons depend upon the
equinoxes.</p>

<p class='c008'>But yet the tropical year is not entirely
satisfactory as a measure of time, because
the number of days contained in it is not an
even one. Its length is 366 days, 5 hours,
48 minutes, 46 seconds. Accordingly, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the irregularities of apparent solar time were
avoided by the invention of mean solar time,
so the difficulty presented by the tropical
year is gotten rid of, as far as possible, by
means of what is called the civil year, or
the calendar year, the average length of
which is almost exactly equal to that of
the tropical year. This brings us to the
consideration of the calendar, which is as
full of compromises as a political treaty—but
there is no help for it since nature did
not see fit to make the day an exact fraction
of the year, or, in other words, to make the
day and the year commensurable quantities
of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without going into a history of the reforms
that the calendar has undergone, which would
demand a great deal of space, we may simply
say that the basis of the calendar we use to-day
was established by Julius Cæsar, with
the aid of the Greek astronomer Sosigenes.
This is the Julian calendar, and the reformed
shape in which it exists at present is called
the Gregorian calendar. Cæsar assumed
365¼ days as the true length of the year,
and, in order to get rid of the quarter day,
ordered that it should be left out of account
for three years out of every four. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>fourth year the four quarter days were added
together to make one additional day,
which was added to that particular year.
Thus the ordinary years were each 365
days long and every fourth year was 366
days long. This fourth year was called
the bissextile year. It was identical with
our leap year. The days of both the ordinary
and the leap years were distributed among
the twelve months very much as we distribute
them now.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Cæsar's assumption of 365¼ days
as the length of the year was erroneous,
being about 11 min. 14 sec. longer than the
real tropical year. In the sixteenth century
this error had accumulated to such a degree
that the months were becoming seriously
disjointed from the seasons with which they
had been customarily associated. In consequence,
Pope Gregory XIII, assisted by
the astronomer Clavius, introduced a slight
reform of the Julian calendar. The accumulated
days were dropped, and a new start
taken, and the rule for leap year was changed
so as to read that “all years, whose date-number
is divisible by four without a remainder
are leap years, unless they are century
years (such as 1800, 1900, etc.). The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>century years are not leap years, unless their
date number is divisible by 400, in which
case they are.” And this is the rule as it
prevails to-day, although there is now
(1912) serious talk of undertaking a new
revision. But the Gregorian calendar is
so nearly correct that more than 3000 years
must elapse before the length of the year
as determined by it will differ by one day
from the true tropical year.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject of the reform of the calendar
is a very interesting one, but, together with
that of the rules for determining the date of
Easter, its discussion must be sought in more
extensive works.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one other measure of time,
depending upon the motion of a heavenly
body, which must be mentioned. This is
the month, or the period required for the
moon to make a revolution round the earth.
Here we encounter again the same difficulty,
for the month also is incommensurable with
the year. Then, too, the length of the month
varies according to the way in which it is
reckoned. We have, first, a sidereal revolution
of the moon, which is measured by the
time taken to pass round the earth from one
conjunction with a star to the next. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>is, on the average, 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes,
12 seconds. Next we have a synodical
revolution of the moon, which is measured
by the time it takes in passing from the phase
of new moon round to the same phase again.
This seems the most natural measure of a
month, because the changing phases of the
moon are its most conspicuous peculiarity.
(These will be explained in Part III.) The
length of the month, as thus measured, is,
on the average, 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes,
3 seconds. The reason why the synodical
month is so much longer than the sidereal
month is because new moon can occur only
when the moon is in conjunction with the sun,
<i>i.e.</i> exactly between the earth and the sun, and
in the interval between two new moons the
sun moves onward, so that for the second conjunction
the moon must go farther to overtake
the sun. It will be observed that both of the
month measures are given in average figures.
This is because the moon's motion is not
quite regular, owing partly to the eccentricity
of its orbit and partly to the disturbing
effects of the sun's attraction. The length of
the sidereal revolution varies to the extent of
three hours, and that of the synodical revolution
to the extent of thirteen hours.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>But, whichever measure of the month we
take, it is incommensurate with the year,
<i>i.e.</i> there is not an even number of months
in a year. In ancient times ceaseless efforts
were made to adjust the months to the
measure of the year, but we have practically
given up the attempt, and in our calendar
the lunar months shift along as they will,
while the ordinary months are periods of a
certain number of days, having no relation
to the movements of the moon.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been thought that the period called
a week, which has been used from time
immemorial, may have originated from the
fact that the interval from new moon to the
first quarter and from first quarter to full
moon, etc., is very nearly seven days. But
the week is as incorrigible as all its sisters
in the discordant family of time, and there
is no more difficult problem for human ingenuity
than that of inventing a system of
reckoning, in which the days, the weeks,
the months, and the years shall be adjusted
to the closest possible harmony.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PART III.<br /> <br />THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'><b>1. The Sun.</b> By the term solar system
is meant the sun together with the system
of bodies (planets, asteroids, comets and
meteors) revolving round it. The sun, being
a star, every other star, for all that we can
tell, may be the ruler of a similar system.
In fact, we <i>know</i> that a few stars have huge
dark bodies revolving round them, which
may be likened to gigantic planets. The
reason why the sun is the common centre
round which the other members of the solar
system move, is because it vastly exceeds
all of them put together in mass, or quantity
of matter, and the power of any body to set
another body in motion by its attractive
force depends upon mass. If a great body
and a small body attract each other, both
will move, but the motion of the small
body will be so much more than that of the
great one that the latter will seem, relatively,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>to stand fast while the small one moves.
Then, if the small body had originally a
motion across the direction in which the
great body attracts it, the result of the combination
will be to cause the small body to
revolve in an orbit (more or less elliptical
according to the direction and velocity of
its original motion) about the great body.
If the difference of mass is very great, the
large body will remain virtually immovable.
This is the case with the sun and its planets.
The sun has 332,000 times as much mass
(or, we may say, is 332,000 times as heavy)
as the earth. It has a little more than a
thousand times as much mass as its largest
planet, Jupiter. It has millions of times as
much as the greatest comet. The consequence
is that all of these bodies revolve
around the sun, in orbits of various degrees
of eccentricity, while the sun itself remains
practically immovable, or just swaying a
little this way and that, like a huntsman
holding his dogs in leash.</p>

<p class='c008'>The distance of the sun from the earth—about
93,000,000 miles—has been determined
by methods which will be briefly explained
in the next section. Knowing its distance,
it is easy to calculate its size, since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>apparent diameter of all objects varies
directly with their distance. The diameter
of the sun is thus found to be about 866,400
miles, or nearly 110 times that of the earth.
In bulk it exceeds the earth about 1,300,000
times, but its mass, or quantity of matter,
is only 332,000 times the earth's, because
its average density is but one quarter that of
the earth. This arises from the fact that
the earth is a solid, compact body, while the
sun is a body composed of gases and vapours
(though in a very compressed state). It
is the high temperature of the sun which
maintains it in this state. Its temperature
has been calculated at about 16,000° Fahrenheit,
but various estimates differ rather
widely. At any rate, it is so hot that the
most refractory substances known to us
would be reduced to the state of vapour,
if removed to the sun. The quantity of heat
received upon the earth from the sun can
only be expressed in terms of the mechanical
equivalent of heat. The unit of heat in
engineering is the calorie, which means the
amount of heat required to raise the temperature
of one kilogram of water (2.2 pounds)
one degree Centigrade (1°.8 Fahrenheit).
Now observation shows that the sun furnishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>30 of these calories per minute upon
every square metre (about 1.2 square yard)
of the earth's surface. Perhaps there is
no better illustration of what this means
than Prof. Young's statement, that “the
heat annually received on each square foot
of the earth's surface, if employed in a perfect
heat engine, would be able to hoist about a
hundred tons to the height of a mile.” Or
take Prof. Todd's illustration of the mechanical
power of the sunbeams: “If we
measure off a space five feet square, the
energy of the sun's rays when falling vertically
upon it is equivalent to one horse
power.” Astronomers ordinarily reckon the
solar constant in “small calories,” which are
but the thousandth part of the engineer's
calorie, and the latest results of the Smithsonian
Institution observations indicate that
the solar constant is about 1.95 of these
small calories per square centimeter per
second. About 30 per cent. must be deducted
for atmospheric absorption.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heat, like gravitation and like light,
varies inversely in intensity with the square
of the distance; hence, if the earth were
twice as near as it is to the sun it would
receive four times as much heat and four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>times as much light, and if it were twice
as far away it would receive only one quarter
as much. This shows how important it is
for a planet not to be too near, or too far
from, the sun. The earth would be vapourised
if it were carried within a quarter of
a million miles of the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun rotates on an axis inclined about
7½° from a perpendicular to the plane
of the ecliptic. The average period of its
rotation is about 25⅓ days—we say “average”
because, not being a solid body, different
parts of its surface turn at different rates.
It rotates faster at the equator than at
latitudes north-and-south of the equator, the
velocity decreasing toward the poles. The
period of rotation at the equator is about
25 days, and at 40° north or south of the
equator it is about 27 days. The direction
of rotation is the same as that of the earth's.</p>

<p class='c008'>The surface of the sun, when viewed with
a telescope, is often seen more or less spotted.
The spots are black, or dusky, and frequently
of very irregular shapes, although many of
them are nearly circular. Generally they
appear in groups drawn out in the direction
of the solar rotation. Some of these groups
cover areas of many millions of square miles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>although the sun is so immense that even
then they appear to the naked eye (guarded
by a dark glass) only as small dark spots on
its surface. The centres of sun-spots, are the
darkest parts. Generally around the borders
of the spots the surface seems to be more or
less heaped up. Often, in large sun-spots,
immense promontories, very brilliant, project
over the dark interior, and many of these are
prolonged into bridges of light, apparently
traversing the chasms beneath. Constant
changes of shape and arrangement take place,
and there are few more astonishing telescopic
objects than a great sun-spot.</p>

<div id='i132'  class='figcenter id002'>

Ritchey, with the two-foot reflector.<br /><br />Observe the strangely twisted look of this long curved nebula; also the curious curves composed of minute stars near it.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The spots are not always visible in equal
numbers, and in some years but few are seen,
and they are small. It has been found that
they occur in periods, averaging about eleven
years from maximum to minimum, although
the length of the period is very irregular.
It has also been observed that when the first
spots of a new period appear, they are
generally seen some 30° from the equator,
either toward the north or toward the south,
and that as the period progresses the spots
increase in size, and seem to draw toward the
equator, the last spots of the period being
seen quite close to the equator, on one side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>or the other. The duration of individual
spots is variable; some last but a day or
two, and others continue for weeks, sometimes
being carried out of view by the rotation
of the sun and brought into view again
from the other side.</p>

<p class='c008'>The surface of the sun in the neighbourhood
of groups of spots is frequently marked
by large areas covered with crinkled bright
lines and patches, which are called faculæ.
These, which are the brightest parts of the
sun, appear to be elevated above the general
level.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to the cause and nature of sun-spots
much remains to be learned. In 1908, Prof.
George E. Hale, by means of an instrument
called the spectro-heliograph, which selects
out of the total radiation of the solar disk
light peculiar to certain elements, and thus
permits the use of that light alone in photographing
the sun, demonstrated that sun-spots
probably arise from vortices, or
whirling storms, and that these vortices
produce strong magnetic fields in the sun-spots.
The phenomenon may be regarded,
says Prof. Hale, as somewhat analogous to
a tornado or waterspout on the earth. The
whirling trombe becomes wider at the top,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>carrying the gases from below upward. At
the centre of the storm the rapid rotation
produces an expansion which cools the
gases and causes the appearance of a comparatively
dark cloud, which we see as the
sun-spot. The vortices whirl in opposite
directions on opposite sides of the sun's
equator, thus obeying the same law that
governs the rotation of cyclones on the
earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has long been a question whether the
condition of the sun as manifested by the
spots upon its surface has an influence upon
the meteorology of the earth. It is known
that the sun-spot period coincides closely
with periodical changes in the earth's magnetism,
and great outbursts on the sun have
frequently been immediately followed by
violent magnetic storms and brilliant displays
of the aurora borealis on the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun undoubtedly exercises other influences
upon the earth than those familiar
to us under the names of gravitation, light,
and heat; but the nature of these other
influences is not yet fully understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brilliant white surface of the sun is
called the photosphere. It has been likened
to a shell of intensely hot clouds, consisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of substances which are entirely vaporous
within the body of the sun. Above the
photosphere lies an envelope, estimated to
be from 5000 to 10,000 miles thick, known
as the chromosphere. It consists mainly
of hydrogen and helium, and when seen
during a total eclipse, when the globe of
the sun is concealed behind the moon, it presents
a brilliant scarlet colour. Above this
are frequently seen splendid red flame-like
objects, named prominences. They are of
two varieties—one cloud-like in appearance,
and the other resembling spikes, or trees
with spreading tops,—but often their forms
are infinitely varied. The latter, the so-called
eruptive prominences, exhibit rapid
motion away from the sun's surface, as if
they consisted of matter which has been
ejected by explosion. Occasionally these
objects have been seen to grow to a height
of several hundred thousand miles, with
velocities of two or three hundred miles
per second.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun has still another envelope, of
changing form,—the corona. This apparently
consists of rare gaseous matter, whose
characteristic constituent is an element unknown
on the earth, called coronium. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>corona appears in the form of a luminous
halo, surrounding the hidden sun during
a total eclipse, and it often extends outward
several million miles. Its shape varies in
accordance with the sun-spot period. It has
a different appearance and outline at a time
of maximum sun-spots from those which it
presents at a minimum. There are many
things about the corona which suggest the
play of electric and magnetic forces. The
corona, although evidently always existing,
is never seen except during the few minutes
of complete obscuration of the sun that
occurs in a total eclipse. This is because
its light is not sufficiently intense to render
it visible, when the atmosphere around the
observer is illuminated by the direct rays
of sunlight.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>2. Parallax.</b> We now return to the
question of the sun's distance from the earth,
which we treat in a separate section, because
thus it is possible to present, at a single
view, the entire subject of the measurement
of the distances of the heavenly bodies.
The common basis of all such measurements
is furnished by what is called parallax, which
may be defined as the difference of direction
of an object when viewed alternately from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>two separate points. The simplest example
of parallax is found in looking at an object
first with one eye and then with the other
without, in the meantime, altering the
position of the head. Suppose you sit in
front of a window through which you can
see the wall of a house on the opposite side
of the street. Choose one of the vertical
bars of the window-sash, and, closing the
left eye, look at the bar with the right and
note where it seems to be projected against
the wall. Then close the right eye and open
the left, and you will observe that the place
of projection of the bar has shifted toward
the right. This change of direction is due
to parallax and its amount depends both
upon the distance between the eyes and upon
the distance of the window from the observer.
To see how this principle is applied by the
astronomer, let us suppose that we wish to
ascertain the distance of the moon. The
moon is so far away that the distance between
the eyes is infinitesimal in comparison,
so that no parallactic shift in its direction
is apparent on viewing it alternately with
the two eyes. But by making the observations
from widely separated points on
the earth we can produce a parallactic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>shifting of the moon's position which will
be easily measurable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let one of the points of observation be
in the northern hemisphere and the other
in the southern, thousands of miles apart.
The two observers might then be compared
to the eyes of an enormous head, each of
which sees the moon in a measurably
different direction. If the northern observer
carefully ascertains the angular distance
of the moon from his zenith, and the southern
observer does the same with regard to <i>his</i>
zenith, as indicated in Fig. 12, they can,
by a combination of their measurements,
construct a quadrilateral <span class='fss'>A C B M</span>, of which
all the angles may be ascertained from the
two measurements, while the length of the
sides <span class='fss'>A C</span> and <span class='fss'>B C</span> is already known, since
they are each equal to the radius of the
earth. With these data it is easy, by the
rules of plane trigonometry, to calculate
the length of the other sides, and also the
length of the straight line from the centre
of the earth to the moon. In all such
cases the distance between the points of
observation is called the base-line, whose
length is known to start with, while the
angles formed by the lines of direction at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the opposite ends of the base-line are ascertained
by measurement.</p>

<p><i>Fig. 12. Parallax of the Moon.</i><br /><br />Let C be the centre of the earth, A and B the stations of two observers, one in the northern, the other in the southern hemisphere, and M the moon. The lines C A Z and C B Z′ indicate the direction of the zenith at A and B respectively. Subtracting the measured angles at A and B each from 180° gives the inside angles at those points. The angle at C is equal to the sum of the latitudes of A and B since they are on opposite sides of the equator. With three angles known, the fourth, at M, is found by simply subtracting their sum from 360°.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the case of the sun the distance concerned
is so great (about 400 times that of
the moon) that the parallax produced by
viewing it from different points on the earth
is too small to be certainly measured, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>a modification of the method has to be
employed. One such modification, which
has been much used, depends upon the fact
that the planet Venus, being nearer the sun
than the earth is, appears, at certain times,
passing directly over the face of the sun.
This is called a transit of Venus. During
a transit, Venus is between three and four
times nearer the earth than the sun is, and
consequently its parallactic displacement,
when viewed from widely separated points
on the earth, is much greater than that of
the sun. One of the ways in which the
astronomer takes advantage of this fact is
shown in Fig. 13. Let A and B be two
points on opposite sides of the earth, but
both somewhere near the equator. As Venus
swings along in its orbit to pass between
the earth and the sun, it will manifestly be
seen just touching the sun's edge sooner
from A than from B. The observer at A
notes with extreme accuracy the exact
moment when he sees Venus apparently
touch the sun. Several minutes later, the
observer at B will see the same phenomenon,
and he also notes accurately the time of the
apparent contact. Now, since we know from
ordinary observation the time that Venus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>requires to make one complete circuit of
its orbit, we can, by simple proportion,
calculate, from the time that it takes to pass
from v to v<sup>1</sup>, the angular distance between
the lines A S and B S, or in other words the
size of the angle at S, which is equal to the
parallactic displacement of the sun, as seen
from opposite ends of the earth's diameter.
Knowing, to begin with, the distance between
A and B, we have the means of determining
the length of all the other lines in the triangle,
and hence the distance of the sun. This
process is known as Delisle's method.
There is another method, called Halley's,
but in a brief treatise of this kind we cannot
enter into a description of it. It suffices
to say that both depend upon the same fundamental
principles.</p>

<p><i>Fig. 13. Parallax of the Sun from Transit of Venus</i>.<br /><br />(For description see text.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It must be added, however, that other
ways of measuring the sun's distance than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>are afforded by transits of Venus have been
developed. One of these depends upon
observation of the asteroid Eros, which
periodically approaches much nearer to the
earth than Venus ever does. By observing
the parallax of Eros, when it is nearest the
earth, its distance can be ascertained, and
that being known the distance of the sun
is immediately deducible from it, because,
by the third law of Kepler (to be explained
later), the <i>relative</i> distances of all the planets
from the sun are proportional to their
periods of revolution, so that if we know any
one of the distances in miles we can calculate
all the others. It is important here to
state the angular amount of the sun's parallax,
since it is a quantity which is continually
referred to in books on astronomy. According
to the latest determination, based on
observations of Eros, the solar parallax is
8″.807, which corresponds, in round numbers,
to a distance of 92,800,000 miles. A
mean parallax of 8″.796 is given by Mr. C. G.
Abbot, based on a combination of results
from a number of different methods, and this
corresponds to a distance of 92,930,000 miles.
To the astronomer, who seeks extreme exactness,
the slightest difference is important.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>It should be noted that the figures 8″.807 or
8″.796 represent the parallactic displacement
of the sun, as seen not from the opposite
ends of the earth's entire diameter, but from
opposite ends of its radius, or semi-diameter.
Accordingly it is equal to half of the angle
at S in Fig. 13. It is for convenience of
calculation that, in such cases, the astronomer
employs the semi-diameter, instead of the
whole diameter for his base-line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The case of the stars must next be considered,
and now we find that the distances
involved are so enormous that the diameter,
or semi-diameter, of the earth is altogether
too insignificant a quantity to afford an
available base-line for the measurement.
We should have remained forever ignorant
of star distances but for the effects produced
by the earth's change of place due to its
annual revolution round the sun. The mean
diameter of the earth's orbit is about
186,000,000 miles, and we are able to make
use of this immense distance as a base-line
for ascertaining the parallax of a star.
Suppose, for instance, that the direction
of a star in the sky is observed on the 1st
of January, and again on the 1st of July.
In the meantime, the earth will have passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>from one end of the base-line just described
to the other, and unless the star observed
is extremely remote, a careful comparison
of the two measurements of direction will
reveal a perceptible parallax, from which
the actual distance of the star in question
can be deduced.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is to be observed that if all the stars
were equally distant this method would fail,
because then there would be no “background”
against which the shift of place could be
observed; all of the stars would shift together.
But, in fact, the vast majority of the stars
are so remote that even a base-line of
186,000,000 miles is insufficient to produce
a measurable shift in their direction. It is
only the distances of the nearer stars which
we can measure, and for them the multitude
of more remote ones serves, like the wall of
the house in the experiment with the window-bar,
as a background on which the shift
of place can be noted. Just as in calculations
of the sun's parallax the semi-diameter of
the earth is chosen for a base-line, so in the
case of the stars the semi-diameter of the
earth's orbit, amounting to 93,000,000 miles,
forms the basis. Measured in this way the
parallaxes of the nearest stars come out in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>tenths, or hundredths, of a second of arc,
or angular measurement. Thus the parallax
of Alpha Centauri, the nearest known star,
is about 0″.75, corresponding to a distance
of about 26,000,000,000,000 miles. Now
0″.75 is a quantity inappreciable to the naked
eye, and only to be measured with delicate
instruments, and yet this almost invisible
shift of direction is all that is produced by
viewing the nearest star in the sky from the
opposite ends of a base-line 93,000,000 miles
long!</p>

<p class='c008'><b>3. Spectroscopic Analysis.</b> We have next
to deal with the constitution of the sun,
or the nature of the substances of which it
consists, and for this purpose we must first
understand the operation of the spectroscope,
in many respects the most wonderful instrument
that man has invented. It has
given birth to the “chemistry of the sun”
and the “chemistry of the stars,” for by its
aid we can be as certain of the nature of many
of the substances of which they are made
as we could be by actually visiting them.</p>

<div id='i147'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 14. Spectrum Analysis.</i><br /><br />The red is least turned by the prism from its original course and the violet most. If between the prism and the screen on which the spectrum falls there were interposed a gas of any kind that gas would absorb from the coloured rays passing through it the exact waves of light with which it would itself shine if it were made luminous by heat. It would not take out an entire section, or colour, from the spectrum, but only a small part of one or more of the colours, and the absence of these parts would be indicated on the screen by narrow black lines situated in various places; and these lines, in number and in situation, would differ with every different kind of gas that was interposed. If several kinds were interposed simultaneously they would all pick out their own peculiar rays from the light, and thus the spectrum would be crossed by a large number of dark lines, by the aid of which the nature of the various gases that produced them could be told. The effect would be the same if the gases were interposed in the path of the white light before it enters the prism;—and this, in fact, is what happens when the spectrum of the sun, or a star, is examined—the absorption has already occurred at the surface of the luminous body before the light comes to the earth.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Fundamentally, spectroscopic analysis depends
upon the principle of refraction, of
which we have spoken in connection with
the atmosphere. Although the most powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>spectroscopes are now made on a different
plan, the working of the instrument can
best be comprehended by considering it in
the form in which it was first invented, and
in which it is still most often used. In its
simplest form the spectroscope consists of
a three-angle prism of glass, through which a
ray of light is sent from the sun, star, or
other luminous object to be examined.
Glass, like air or water, has the property
of refracting, or bending, all rays of light
that enter it in an inclined direction. In
passing through two of the opposite-sloping
sides of a prism, the ray is twice bent, once
on entering and again on leaving, in accordance
with the principle that we have already
mentioned (see Part II, Sect. 4). Still,
merely bending the ray out of its original
course would have no important result
but for another associated phenomenon,
known as dispersion. To explain dispersion
we must recall the familiar fact that white
light consists of a number of coloured components
which, when united, make white.
It is usual to speak of these primary, or
prismatic, colours, as seven in number.
These are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet. Physicists now assign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>a different list of primary colours, but these,
being generally familiar, will best serve our
purpose. Without going into an explanation
of the reasons, it will suffice to say that the
waves of light producing these fundamental
colours are not all equally affected by refraction.
The red is least, and the violet most,
bent out of its course in passing through the
prism, the other colours being bent more and
more in proportion to their distance from the
red. It follows that the ray, or beam, of
light, which was white when it entered the
prism, becomes divided or dispersed during
its passage into a brush of seven different
hues. Thus the prism may be said to analyse
the light into its fundamental colours,
making them separately visible. This, as
a scientific fact, dates from the time of Newton.
But Newton did not dream of the
further magic that lay in the prism.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was noticed as early as 1801 that, when
the light of the sun was dispersed in the way
we have described, not only did the seven
primary colours make their appearance,
but across the ribbon-like band, called the
spectrum, that was thus formed, ran a
number of thin black lines, like narrow gaps
in the band. The position of these lines was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>carefully studied by a German astronomer,
Fraunhofer, in 1814, and they still bear the
name of Fraunhofer lines. But the full
explanation of them did not come until 1858
when, with their aid, Kirschoff laid the foundations
of spectrum analysis.</p>

<p class='c008'>This analysis is based upon the fact that
the Fraunhofer lines are visual indications of
the existence of certain substances in the
sun. To explain this we must know three
fundamental facts:</p>

<p class='c008'>1st: Every incandescent body that is either
solid or liquid (or, if it consists of gases,
is under high pressure) shines with compound
white light, which, when dispersed by prisms,
gives a <i>continuous</i> coloured band, or spectrum.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d: Every elementary substance when in
the gaseous state, and under low pressure,
if brought to incandescence by heat, shines
with light which, when dispersed, gives a
<i>discontinuous</i> spectrum, made up of separate
bright lines; and each different element
possesses its own peculiar spectral lines,
never coinciding in position with the lines
of any other element.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d: If the light from a body giving a
continuous spectrum is caused to pass
through a gas which is at a lower temperature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the gas will absorb precisely those light
waves, of which its own spectrum is composed
and will leave in the spectrum of the body
a series of dark lines, or gaps, whose number
and position indicate the nature of the gas
whose absorptive action has produced them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, to apply these principles to the sun
we have only to remember that it is a globe
of gaseous substances, which are under
great pressure, owing to the immense force
of the sun's gravitation. Consequently it
gives a continuous spectrum. But, at the
same time, it is surrounded with gaseous
envelopes, which are not as much compressed
as the internal gases are, and which
are at a lower temperature because they
come in contact with the cold of surrounding
space. The light from the body of the
sun must necessarily pass through these
envelopes, and each of the gases of which
they consist absorbs from the passing sunlight
its own peculiar rays, with the result
that the spectrum of the sun is seen crossed
with a great number of black lines—the
Fraunhofer lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be remarked that the evidence
which the Fraunhofer lines afford concerning
the composition of the sun applies, strictly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>only to the outer portion, or to the envelopes
of gaseous matter that surround the interior
globe. But since there is every reason to
believe that the entire body of the sun is
in a gaseous state, notwithstanding the
internal pressure, and since we see that
there is a continual circulation going on
between the inner and outer portions, it is
logical to conclude that essentially the same
elements exist under varying conditions in
all parts of the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this way, then, we have learned the
composition of the sun, and we find that it
consists of virtually the same elementary
substances found upon the earth, but existing
there in a gaseous or vaporous state.
Among the elements which have been
positively identified in the sun by means of
their characteristic spectral lines are iron,
calcium, sodium, aluminum, copper, zinc,
silver, lead, potassium, nickel, tin, silicon,
manganese, magnesium, cobalt, hydrogen,
and at least twenty others which are likewise
found upon the earth. Some elementary
substances known on the earth, such as
gold and oxygen, have not yet been certainly
found in the sun, but there is every reason
to believe that they all exist there, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>perhaps under conditions which render their
detection difficult or impossible. Helium
was recognised as an element in the sun,
by giving spectral lines different from any
known substance, and it received its name
“sun-metal,” long before it was discovered
on the earth. We have seen that there is
at least one element in the sun, coronium,
which, as far as we know, does not exist
at all upon the earth, and it is not improbable
that there may be others which have no
counterparts on the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same kind of analysis applies to the
stars, no matter how far away they may be,
so long as they give sufficient light to form
a spectrum. And in this way it has been
found that the stars differ somewhat from
the sun and from one another in their composition,
and thus a classification of the stars
has been made, and it has been possible to
draw conclusions concerning their relative
age, which show that some stars are comparatively
younger than the sun, others
older, and others so far advanced in age,
or evolution, that they are drawing near
extinction. Many dark bodies also exist
among the stars, which appear to be completely
extinguished suns. It only remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>to add on this subject that, according to
prevailing theories, the earth itself was once
an incandescent body, shining with its own
light, and at that time it, too, would have
yielded a spectrum showing of what substances
it consisted.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>4. The Moon.</b> The earth is a satellite
of the sun, and the moon is a satellite of the
earth. The mean, or average, distance of
the sun from the earth is about 93,000,000
miles; the mean distance of the moon is a
little less than 239,000 miles. This distance
is variable to the extent of about 31,000
miles, owing to the eccentricity of the moon's
orbit about the earth. That is, the moon is
sometimes nearly 253,000 miles away, and
sometimes only about 221,600. The diameter
of the moon is 2163 miles. Its bulk is one-forty-ninth
that of the earth, but its mass is
only one-eightieth, because its mean density
is only about six-tenths as great as the earth's.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moon appears to travel in an orbit
round the earth, but in fact the orbit is
always concave toward the sun, and the
disturbing attraction of the earth, as the
two move together round the sun, causes
it to appear now on one side and now on the
other. But we may treat the moon's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>orbit as if the earth were the true centre
of force, the attraction of the sun being regarded
as the disturbing element.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to a mathematical theory, which
has been largely accepted as probably true,
but into which we cannot enter here (see
Prof. George Darwin's <i>The Tides</i>, or Prof.
R. Ball's <i>Time and Tide</i>), the moon was
thrown off from the earth many ages ago,
as a consequence of tidal “friction.” As it
moves round in its orbit the moon keeps
the same face toward the earth. This fact is
also ascribed to tidal influence.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Apparently the moon has no atmosphere,
or if it has any it is too rare to be certainly
detected. On its surface, there is no appearance
of water. Consequently we cannot
suppose it to be inhabited, at least by any
forms of life familiar to us on the earth.
But when the moon is viewed with a telescope
large relatively flat areas are seen, which
some think may have been the beds of seas
in ancient times. They are still called <i>maria</i>,
or “seas,” and are visible to the naked eye
in the form of great irregular dusky regions.
Nearly two-thirds of the surface of the moon,
as we see it, consists of bright regions, which
are very broken and mountainous. Most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>of the mountains of the moon are roughly
circular, surrounding enormous depressions,
which look like gigantic pits. For this
reason they are called lunar volcanoes, but,
to say nothing of their immense size—for
many are fifty or sixty miles across—they
differ in many ways from the volcanoes of
the earth. It suffices to point out that what
resemble volcanic craters are not situated,
as is the case on the earth, at the summits
of mountains, but are vast sink-holes, descending
thousands of feet below the general
surface of the moon. Their real origin is
unknown, but it is possible that volcanic
forces may have produced them. (For a
description, with photographs, of these
gigantic formations in the lunar world, see
the present author's <i>The Moon</i>.) In addition
to the circular mountains, or craters,
there are several long and lofty chains of
lunar mountains much resembling terrestrial
mountain ranges.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to the absence of air and water from
the moon, some have supposed that they
once existed, but, in the course of ages,
have disappeared, either by absorption,
partly mechanical and partly chemical, into
the interior rocks, or by escaping into space
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>on account of the slight force of gravity on
the moon, which appears to be insufficient to
enable it to retain, permanently, such volatile
gases as oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.
This leads us to consider the force of the
moon's attraction at its surface. We have
seen that spherical bodies attract as if their
whole mass were collected at their centres.
We also know that the force of attraction
varies directly as the mass of the attracting
body and inversely as the square of the
distance from its centre. Now the mass of
the moon is one-eightieth that of the earth, so
that, upon bodies situated at an equal distance
from the centres of both, the moon's
attraction would be only one-eightieth of
the earth's. But the diameter of the moon
is not very much more than one quarter
that of the earth, and for the sake of round
numbers let us call it one quarter. It
follows that an object on the surface of the
moon is four times nearer the centre of
attraction than is an object on the surface
of the earth, and since the force varies
inversely as the square of the distance the
moon's attraction upon bodies on its surface
is relatively sixteen times as great as the
earth's. But the total force of the earth's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>attraction is eighty times greater than the
moon's. In order, then, to find the real
relative attraction of the moon at its surface
we must divide 80 by 16, the quotient, 5,
showing the ratio of the earth's force of
attraction at its surface to that of the moon
at <i>its</i> surface. In other words, this calculation
shows that the moon draws bodies
on its surface with only one-fifth the force
with which the same bodies would be drawn
on the earth's surface. The weight of bodies
of equal mass would, therefore, be only
one-fifth as great on the moon as on the
earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the real difference is greater than this,
for we have used round numbers, which
exaggerated the size of the earth as compared
with that of the moon. If we employ the
fractional numbers which show the actual
ratio of the moon's radius (half-diameter) to
that of the earth, we shall find that the
weight of the same body would be only
about one-sixth as great on the moon as
on the earth. It has been thought that this
relative lack of weight on the moon may
account for the gigantic proportions assumed
by its craters, since the same elective force
would throw volcanic matter to a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>greater height and distance there than on
our planet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The connection of the slight force of gravity
on the moon with its ability to retain an
atmosphere is shown by the following considerations.
It is possible to calculate for
any planet of known mass the velocity with
which a particle would have to move in
order to escape from the control of that
planet. In the case of the earth this critical
velocity, as it is called, amounts to about
7 miles per second, and in the case of the
moon to only 1½ miles per second. Now
the kinetic theory of gases informs us that
their molecules are continually flying in
all directions with velocities varying with
the nature and the temperature of the gas.
The maximum velocity of the molecules of
oxygen is 1.8 miles per second, of hydrogen
7.4 miles, of nitrogen 2 miles, of water
vapour 2.5 miles. It is evident, then, that
the force of the earth's attraction is sufficient
permanently to retain all these gases except
hydrogen, and in fact there is no gaseous
hydrogen in the atmosphere, that element
being found on the earth only in combination
with other substances. But oxygen and
nitrogen, which constitute the bulk of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>atmosphere, have maximum molecular velocities
much less than the critical velocity
above described. In the case of the moon,
however, the critical velocity is less than those
of the molecules of oxygen, nitrogen, and
water vapour, to say nothing of hydrogen;
therefore the moon cannot permanently
retain them. We say “permanently,” because
they might be retained for a time
for the reason that the molecules of a gas
fly in all directions, and continual collisions
occur among them in the interior of the
gaseous mass, so that it would be only those
at the exterior of the atmosphere which
would escape; but gradually all that remained
free from combination would get away.</p>

<p><i>Fig. 15. The Phases of the Moon.</i><br /><br />As the moon goes round the earth in the direction indicated by the arrows, the sun remaining always on the left-hand side, it is evident that the illuminated half of the moon will be turned away from the earth at new moon, and toward it at full moon, while between these positions more or less will be seen according to the direction of the moon with regard to the sun.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As the moon travels round the earth
it shows itself in different forms, gradually
changing from one into another, which are
known as phases. If the moon shone with
light of its own its outline would always be
circular, like the sun's. The apparent change
of form is due, first, to its being an opaque
globe, reflecting the sunlight that falls upon
it, and necessarily illuminated on only one
side at a time; and second, to the fact that as
it travels round the earth the half illuminated
by the sun is sometimes turned directly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>toward us, at other times only partly toward
us, and at still other times directly away
from us. When it is in that part of its orbit
which passes between the sun and the earth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the moon, so to speak, has its back turned
to us, the illuminated side being, of course,
toward the sun. It is then invisible, and
this unseen phase is the true “new moon.”
It is customary, however, to give the name
new moon to the narrow, sickle-shaped
figure, which it shows in the west, after
sunset, a few days after the date of the real
new moon. The sickle gradually enlarges
into a half circle as the moon passes away
from the sun, and the half circle phase,
which occurs when the moon arrives at a
position in the sky at right angles to the
direction of the sun, is called first quarter.
After first quarter the moon begins to move
round behind the earth, with respect to the
sun, and when it has arrived just behind
the earth, its whole illuminated face is
turned toward the earth, because the sun,
which causes the illumination, is on that
same side. This phase is called full
moon. Afterward the moon returns round
the other part of its orbit toward its original
position between the earth and the
sun, and as it does so, it again assumes,
first, the form of a half circle, which in this
case is called third, or last, quarter, then
that of a sickle, known as “old moon,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>finally disappears once more to become new
moon again.</p>

<p class='c008'>A perfectly evident explanation of these
changes of form, clearer than any description,
can be graphically obtained in this way.
Take a billiard ball, a croquet ball, or a
perfectly round, smooth, and tightly rolled
ball of white yarn, and, placing yourself
not too near a brightly burning lamp and
sitting on a piano stool (in order to turn
more easily), hold the ball up in the light,
and cause it to revolve round you by turning
upon the stool. As it passes from a position
between you and the lamp to one on the opposite
side from the lamp, and so on round
to its original position, you will see its
illuminated half go through all the changes
of form exhibited by the moon, and you will
need no further explanation of the lunar
phases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Harvest Moon and the Hunter's
Moon, which are popularly celebrated not
only on account of their romantic associations,
but also because in some parts of the
world they afford a useful prolongation of
light after sunset, occur only near the time
of the autumnal equinox, and they are
always full moons. The full moon nearest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the date of the equinox, September 23d, is
the Harvest Moon, and the full moon next
following is the Hunter's Moon. Their
peculiarity is that they rise, for several
successive evenings, almost at the same hour,
immediately after sunset. This is due to the
fact that at that time of the year the ecliptic,
from which the moon's path does not very
widely depart, is, in high latitudes, nearly
parallel with the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The full moon in winter runs higher in the
sky, and consequently gives a brighter light,
than in summer. The reason is because,
since the full moon must always be opposite
to the sun, and since toe sun in winter runs
low, being south of the equator, the full moon
rides proportionally high.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>5. Eclipses.</b> We have mentioned the
connection of the moon with the tides, but
there is another phenomenon in which the
moon plays the most conspicuous part—that
of eclipses. There are two kinds of
eclipses—solar and lunar. In the former
it is the moon that causes the eclipse, by
hiding the sun from view; and in the latter
it is the moon that suffers the eclipse, by
passing through the shadow which the earth
casts into space on the side away from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>sun. In both cases, in order that there may
be an eclipse it is necessary that the three
bodies, the moon, the sun, and the earth,
shall be nearly on a straight line, drawn
through their centres. Since the moon
occupies about a month in going round the
earth there would be two eclipses in every
such period (one of the sun and the other
of the moon), if the moon's orbit lay exactly
in the plane of the ecliptic, or of the earth's
orbit. But, in fact, the orbit of the moon is
inclined to that plane at an angle of something
over 5°. Even so, there would be
eclipses every month if the two opposite
points, called nodes, where the moon crosses
the plane of the ecliptic, always lay in a
direct line with the earth and the sun; but
they do not lie thus. If, then, the moon
comes between the earth and the sun when
she is in a part of her orbit several degrees
above or below the plane of the ecliptic, it
is evident that she will pass either above or
below the straight line joining the centres of
the earth and the sun, and consequently
cannot hide the latter. But, since eclipses
do occur in some months and do not occur
in others, we must conclude that the situation
of the nodes changes, and such is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>fact. In consequence of the conflicting
attractions of the sun and the earth, the
orbit of the moon, although, like that of
the earth, it always retains nearly the same
shape and the same inclination, swings round
in space, so that the nodes, or crossing
points on the ecliptic, continually change
their position, revolving round the earth.
This motion may be compared to that of
the precession of the equinoxes, but it is
much more rapid, a complete revolution
occurring in a period of about nineteen years.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this it follows that sometimes the
moon in passing its nodes will be in a line
with the sun, and sometimes will not. But,
owing to the fact that the sun and moon are
not mere points, but on the contrary present
to our view circular disks, each about half
a degree in diameter, an eclipse may occur
even if the moon is not in an exact line with
the centres of the sun and the earth. The
edge of the moon will overlap the sun, and
there will be a partial eclipse, if the centres
of the two bodies are within one degree
apart. Now, the inclination of the moon's
orbit to the ecliptic being only a little over
5°, it is apparent that in approaching one of
its nodes, along so gentle a slope, it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>come within less than a degree of the ecliptic
while still quite far from the node. Thus,
eclipses occur for a considerable time before
and after the moon passes a node. The
distances on each side of the node, within
which an eclipse of the sun may occur, are
called the solar ecliptic limits, and they
amount to 18° in either direction, or 36° in
sum. Within these limits the sun may be
wholly or partially eclipsed according as the
moon is nearer to, or farther from, the node.
If she is exactly at, or very close to, the node
the eclipse will be total.</p>

<p class='c008'>Solar eclipses vary in another way. What
would be a total eclipse, under other circumstances,
may be only an annular eclipse
if the moon happens to be near her greatest
distance from the earth. We have described
the variations in her distance due to the
eccentricity of her orbit, and we have said
that the orbit itself swings round the earth
in such a way as to cause the nodes continually
to change their places on the ecliptic.
The motion of the orbit also causes the lunar
apsides, or the points where she is at her
greatest and least distances from the earth,
to change their places, but their revolution
is opposite in direction to that of the nodes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>as the revolution of the apsides of the earth's
orbit is opposite to that of the equinoxes.
The moon's apsides sometimes move eastward
and sometimes westward, but upon the
whole the eastward motion prevails and the
apsides complete one revolution in that direction
once in about nine and one-half years.
In consequence of the combined effects
of the revolution of the nodes and that of
the apsides, the moon is sometimes at her
greatest distance from the earth at the
moment when she passes centrally over the
sun, and sometimes at her least distance,
or she may be at any intervening distance.
If she is in the nearer part of her orbit,
her disk just covers that of the sun, and the
eclipse is total; if she is in the farther part
(since the apparent size of bodies diminishes
with increase of distance), her disk does not
entirely cover the sun, and a rim of the
latter is visible all around the moon. This
is called an annular eclipse, because of the
ring shape of the part of the sun remaining
visible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The length of the shadow which the moon
casts toward the earth during a solar eclipse
also plays an important part in these phenomena.
This length varies with the distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>from the sun. Since the moon accompanies
the earth, it follows that when the latter
is in aphelion, or at its greatest distance from
the sun, the moon is also at its greatest
mean distance from the sun, and the length
of the lunar shadow may, in such circumstances,
be as much as 236,000 miles. When
the earth, attended by the moon, is in
perihelion, the length of the moon's shadow
may be only about 228,000 miles. The
average length of the shadow is about 232,000
miles. This is nearly 7000 miles less than
the average distance of the moon from the
earth, so it is evident that generally the
shadow is too short to reach the earth, and
it would never reach it, and there would
never be a total eclipse of the sun, but for
the varying distance of the moon from the
earth. When the moon is nearest the earth,
or in perigee, its distance may be as small as
221,600 miles, and in all cases when near
perigee it is near enough for the shadow to
reach the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inasmuch, as the moon's shadow, even
under the most favourable circumstances,
is diminished almost to a point before touching
the earth, it hardly need be said that it
can cover but a very small area on the earth's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>surface. Its greatest possible diameter cannot
exceed about 167 miles, but ordinarily it
is much smaller. If both the earth and the
moon were motionless, this shadow would be a
round or oblong dot on the earth, its shape
varying according as it fell square or sloping
to the surface; but since the moon is continually
advancing in its orbit, and the earth is
continually rotating on its axis, the shadow
moves across the earth, in a general west
to east direction. But the precise direction
varies with circumstances, as does also the
speed. The latter can never be less than
about a thousand miles per hour, and that,
only in the neighbourhood of the equator.
The moon advances eastward about 2100
miles per hour, and the earth's surface turns
in the same direction with a velocity diminishing
from about a thousand miles an hour
at the equator to 0 at the poles. It is the
difference between the velocity of the earth's
rotation and that of the moon's orbital
revolution which determines the speed of
the shadow. The greatest time, which the
shadow can occupy in passing a particular
point on the earth is only eight minutes, but
ordinarily this is reduced to one, two, or
three minutes. The true shadow only lasts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>during the time that the moon covers the
whole face of the sun, but before and after
this total obscuration of the solar disk the
sun is seen partially covered by the moon,
and these partial phases of the eclipse may
be seen from places far aside from the track
which the central shadow pursues. It is
only during a total eclipse, and only from
points situated within the shadow track, that
the solar corona is visible.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a lunar eclipse it is the earth that is
the intervening body, and its shadow falls
upon the moon. A solar eclipse can only
occur at the time of new moon, and a lunar
eclipse only at the time of full moon. The
shadow of the earth is much longer and
broader than that of the moon, and it never
fails to reach the moon, so that it is not
necessary here to consider its varying length.
The width, or diameter, of the shadow at
the average distance of the moon from the
earth is about 5700 miles. The moon may
pass through the centre of the shadow, or
to one side of the centre, or merely dip into
the edge of it. When it goes deep enough
into the shadow to be entirely covered,
the eclipse is total; otherwise it is partial.
Since in a total lunar eclipse the entire moon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>is covered by the shadow, it is evident that
such an eclipse, unlike a solar one, may be
visible simultaneously from all parts of the
earth which, at the time, lie on the side
facing the moon. In other words, the earth's
shadow does not make merely a narrow
track across the face of the moon, but
completely buries it. When the moon passes
centrally through the shadow, she may
remain totally obscured for about two hours.
But the moon does not completely disappear
at such times, because the refraction
of the earth's atmosphere bends a little
sunlight round its edges and casts it into
the shadow. If the atmosphere round the
edges of the earth happens to be thickly
charged with clouds, but little light is thus
refracted into the shadow, and the moon
appears very faint, or almost entirely disappears.
But this is rare, and ordinarily
the eclipsed moon shines with a pale copperish
light.</p>

<p class='c008'>The occurrence of a lunar eclipse is governed
by similar circumstances to those affecting
solar eclipses. The lunar ecliptic limits,
or the distance on each side of the node
within which an eclipse may occur, vary
from 9½° to 12¼° in either direction.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Taking all the various circumstances into
account, it is found that there may be,
though rarely, seven eclipses in a year,
two being of the moon and five of the sun,
and that the least possible number of eclipses
in a year is two, in which case both will be
of the sun. Taking into account also all
the various positions which the sun and moon
occupy with regard to the earth, it is found
that there exists a period of 18 years, 11
days, 8 hours, at the return of which eclipses
of both kinds begin to recur again in the
same order that they occur in the next
preceding period. This is called the saros,
and it was known to the Chaldeans 2600
years ago.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>6. The Planets.</b> We have several times
mentioned the fact that, beside the earth,
there are seven other principal planets
revolving round the sun, in the same direction
as the earth, but at various distances.
We shall consider each of these in the order of
its distance from the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>But first it is desirable to explain briefly
certain so-called “laws” which govern the
motions of all the planets. These are known
as Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and
are three in number. The demonstration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of their truth would carry us beyond the
scope of this book, and consequently we
shall merely state them as they are recognised
by astronomers.</p>

<p class='c008'>1st Law: The orbit of every planet is an
ellipse, having the sun situated in one of the
foci.</p>

<p class='c008'>2d Law: The radius vector of a planet
describes equal areas in equal times. By
the radius vector is meant the straight line
joining the planet to the sun, and the law
declares that as the planet moves round the
sun, the area of space swept over by this
line in any given time, say one day, is equal
to the area which it will sweep over in any
other equal length of time. If the orbit
were a circle it is evident at a glance that the
law must be true, because then the sun would
be situated in the centre of the circle, the
length of the radius vector, no matter where
the planet might be in the orbit, would never
vary, and the area swept over by it in one day
would be equal to the area swept over in
any other day, because all these areas would
be precisely similar and equal triangles.
But Kepler discovered that the same thing
is true when the orbit is an ellipse, and when,
in consequence of the eccentricity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>orbit, the planet is sometimes farther from
the sun than at other times. As the triangular
area swept over in a given time increases
in length with the planet's recession
from the sun, it diminishes in breadth just
enough to make up the difference which
would otherwise exist between the different
areas. This law grows out of the fact that
the force of gravitation varies inversely with
the square of the distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>3d Law: The squares of the periods (<i>i. e.</i>
times of revolution in their orbits) of the
different planets are proportional to the cubes
of their mean (average) distances from the
sun. The meaning of this will be best
explained by an example. Suppose one
planet, whose distance we know, has a period
only one-eighth as long as that of another
planet, whose distance we do not know.
Then Kepler's third law enables us to calculate
the distance of the second planet.
Call the period of the first planet 1, and that
of the second 8, and also call the distance of
the first 1, since all we really need to know
is the <i>relative</i> distance of the second, from
which its distance in miles is readily deduced
by comparison with the distance of the first.
Then, by the law, 1<sup>2</sup> : 8<sup>2</sup> : 1<sup>3</sup> : x<sup>3</sup>  (“x”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>representing the unknown quantity). Now,
this is simply a problem in proportion where
the product of the means is equal to the
product of the extremes. But 1<sup>2</sup> = 1, and also
1<sup>3</sup>= 1; therefore x<sup>3</sup> = 8<sup>2</sup>, and x = ∛(8<sup>2</sup>) (the
cube root of the square of 8), which is 4.
Thus we see that the distance of the second
planet must be four times that of the first.</p>

<p class='c008'>This third law of Kepler is applied to
ascertain the distances of newly discovered
planets, whose periods are easily ascertained
by simple observation. If we know the
distance of any one planet by measurement,
we can calculate the distances of all the
others after observing their periods. The
law also works conversely, <i>i. e.</i> from the
distances the periods can be calculated.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>We now take up the various planets singly.
The nearest to the sun, as far as known,
is Mercury, its average distance being only
36,000,000 miles. But its orbit is so eccentric
that the distance varies from 28,500,000
miles at perihelion to 43,500,000 at aphelion.
In consequence its speed in its orbit is very
variable, and likewise the amount of heat
and light received by it from the sun. On
the average it gets more than 6½ times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>as much solar light and heat as the earth
gets. But at perihelion it gets 2½ times
as much as at aphelion, and the time which
it occupies in passing from perihelion to
aphelion is only six weeks, its entire year
being equal to 88 of our days. Being situated
so much nearer the sun than the
earth is, Mercury is never visible to us
except in the morning or the evening sky,
and then not very far from the sun. Its
diameter is about 3000 miles, but its mass
is not certainly known from lack of knowledge
of its mean density. This lack of
knowledge is due to the fact that Mercury
has no satellite. When a planet has a satellite
it is easy to calculate its density from its
measured diameter combined with the orbital
speed of its satellite. Certain considerations
have led some to believe that the mean density
of Mercury may be very great, perhaps as
great as that of lead, or of the metal mercury
itself. Not knowing the mass, we cannot
say exactly what the weight of bodies on
Mercury is. We are also virtually ignorant
of the condition of the surface of this planet,
the telescope revealing very little detail,
but it is generally thought that it bears a
considerable resemblance to the surface of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the moon. There is another way in which
Mercury is remarkably like the moon. The
latter, as we have seen, always keeps the
same side turned toward the earth, which
is the same thing as saying that it turns once
on its axis, while going once around the
earth. So Mercury keeps always the same
side toward the sun, making one rotation on
its axis in the course of one revolution in
its orbit. Consequently, one side of Mercury
is continually in the sunlight, while the
opposite side is continually buried in night.
There must, however, be regions along the
border between these two sides, where the
sun does rise and set once in the course of one
of Mercury's years. This arises from the
eccentricity of the orbit, and the consequent
variations in the orbital velocity of the planet,
which cause now a little of one edge and now
a little of the other edge of the dark hemisphere
to come within the line of sunlight.
(The same thing occurs with the moon, though
to a less degree owing to the smaller eccentricity
of the moon's orbit, which, however,
is sufficient to enable us to see at one time
a short distance round one side of the moon
and at another time a short distance round
the opposite side.) This phenomenon is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>known as libration. Mercury apparently
possesses an atmosphere, but we know
nothing certain concerning its density.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>The next planet, in the order of distance
from the sun, is Venus, whose average
distance is 67,200,000 miles. The orbit
of Venus is remarkable for its small eccentricity,
so that the difference between its
greatest and least distances from the sun is
less than a million miles. The period, or
year, of Venus is 225 of our days. Owing
to her situation closer to the sun, she gets
nearly twice as much light and heat as the
earth gets. In size Venus is remarkably
like the earth, her diameter being 7713
miles, which differs by only 205 miles from
the mean diameter of the earth. Her axis
is nearly perpendicular to the plane of her
orbit. Her globe is a more perfect sphere
than that of the earth, being very little flattened
at the poles or swollen at the equator.
Although Venus, like Mercury, has no
satellite, her mean density has been calculated
by other means, and is found to be
0.89 that of the earth. From this, in connection
with her measured diameter, it is
easy to deduce her mass, and the force of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>gravity on her surface. The latter comes out
at about 0.85 that of the earth, <i>i. e.</i> a body
weighing 100 pounds on the earth would
weigh 85 pounds if removed to Venus. She
possesses an atmosphere denser and more
extensive than would theoretically have been
expected—indicating, perhaps, a difference
of constitution. Her atmosphere has been
estimated to be twice as dense as ours, a
great advantage, it may be remarked, from
the point of view of aëronautics. But this
dense and abundant atmosphere renders
Venus a very difficult object for the telescope
on account of the brilliance of its reflection.
In consequence, we know but little of the
surface of the planet.</p>

<p class='c008'>One important result of this is that the
question remains undecided whether Venus
rotates on her axis at a rate closely corresponding
with that of the earth, as some
observers think, or whether, as others think,
she, like Mercury, turns only once on her
axis in going once round the sun. The
importance of the question in its bearing
on the habitability of Venus is apparent,
for if she keeps one face always sunward,
then on one side there is perpetual day and
on the other perpetual night. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>other hand, if she has days and nights
approximately equal in length to those of
the earth, it may well be thought that she
is habitable by beings not altogether unlike
ourselves, because the force of gravity on her
surface is not much less than on the earth,
and her dense atmosphere, filled with clouds,
might tend to shield her inhabitants from
the effects of the greater amount of heat
poured upon her by the sun. As her orbit
is inside that of the earth, Venus, like Mercury,
is only visible either in the evening
or in the morning sky, but owing to her
greater actual distance from the sun, her
apparent distance from it in the sky is
greater than that of Mercury.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both of these planets, in consequence of
passing alternately between the sun and the
earth and round the opposite side of the sun,
present phases resembling those of the moon.
The reader can explain these to himself by
means of the experiment, before mentioned,
with a billiard ball and a lamp. In this
case let the observer remain seated in his
chair while another person carries the ball
round the lamp in such a manner that it
shall alternately pass between the lamp and
the observer and round the other side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>lamp. When Venus comes nearly in line
between the earth and the sun, she becomes
an exceedingly brilliant object in either the
evening or the morning sky, although at
such times we see, in the form of a crescent,
only a part of that half of her surface which
is illuminated. Her increase of brightness
at such times is due to her greater nearness
to the earth. When between the earth and
the sun she may be only about 26,000,000
miles away, while when she is on the other
side of the sun she may be over 160,000,000
miles away. Both Venus and Mercury
when passing exactly between the sun and
the earth are seen, in the form of small black
circles, moving slowly across the sun's disk.
These occurrences are called transits, and
in the case of Venus have been before referred
to. They are more frequent with Mercury
than with Venus, but Mercury's transits
are not utilisable for parallax observations.
The latest transit of Venus occurred in
1882, and there will not be another until
2004. The latest transit of Mercury occurred
in 1907, and there will be another in 1914.</p>

<p class='c008'>The earth is the third planet in order of
distance, and then comes Mars, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>average distance from the sun is 141,500,000
miles. The orbit of Mars is so eccentric
that the distance varies between 148,000,000
and 135,000,000 miles. Its period or year
is about 687 of our days. In consequence
of its distance, Mars gets, on the average,
a little less than half as much light and heat
as the earth gets. When it is on the same
side of the sun with the earth, and nearly in
line with them, it is said to be in opposition.
At such times it is manifestly as near the
earth as it can come, and thus an opposition
of Mars offers a good opportunity for the
telescopic study of its surface. These oppositions
occur once in about 780 days,
but they are not all of equal importance,
because the distance between the two planets
is not the same at different oppositions.
The cause of the difference of distance is
the eccentricity of the orbit. If an opposition
occurs when Mars is in aphelion its distance
from the earth will be about 61,000,000
miles, but if the opposition occurs when
Mars is in perihelion the distance will be
only about 35,000,000 miles. The average
distance at an opposition is about 48,500,000
miles. The most favourable oppositions
always occur in August or September,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and are repeated at an interval of from
fifteen to seventeen years. But at some of
the intervening oppositions the distance of
the planet is not too great to afford good
views of its surface. The diameter of Mars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>is about 4330 miles, with a similar polar
flattening to that of the earth. Its density
is 0.71 that of the earth, and the force of
gravity on its surface 0.38. A body weighing
100 pounds on the earth would weigh 38
pounds on Mars. The evidence in regard
to its atmosphere is conflicting, but the
probability is that it has an atmosphere
not denser than that existing on our highest
mountain peaks. Opinions concerning the
existence of water vapour on Mars are also
conflicting. One fact tending to show that
its atmosphere must be very rare and cloudless
is that its surface features are very
plainly discernible with telescopes.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 16. Orbits of Mars and the Earth.</i><br /><br />Inspection shows at once why the oppositions of Mars which occur in August and September are the most favourable because Mars being then near the perihelion point of its elongated orbit is comparatively near the earth, while oppositions which occur in February and March are very unfavourable because then Mars is near the aphelion point of its orbit, and its distance from the earth is much greater. The oppositions occur along the more favourable part of the orbit about two years and two months apart. Thus the figure shows that the opposition of September 24, 1909 was followed by one on November 25, 1911.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>About each pole, as it happens to be turned
earthward, is to be seen a round white patch
(supposed to be snow), and this gradually
disappears as the summer advances in that
hemisphere of the planet—for Mars has
seasons very closely resembling our seasons,
except that they are about twice as long.
The inclination of the axis of Mars to the
plane of its orbit is about 24° 50′, which is
not very different from the inclination of
the earth's axis. Moreover, Mars rotates
in a period of 24 hours, 37 min., 22 sec.,
so that the length of day and night upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>its surface is very nearly the same as upon
the earth. The surface of the planet is
marked by broad irregular areas of contrasting
colour, or tone, some of them being
of a slightly reddish, or yellowish, hue,
and others of a neutral dusky tint. The
general resemblance to a globe of the earth,
with differently shaped seas and oceans,
is striking.</p>

<p class='c008'>On account of the many likenesses between
Mars and the earth, some astronomers
are disposed to think that Mars may be a
habitable planet. The terms “seas” and
“continents” were formerly applied to the
contrasted areas just spoken of, but now it
is believed that there are no large bodies of
water on Mars. Crossing the light, or
reddish-coloured, areas there are sometimes
seen great numbers of intersecting lines,
very narrow and faint, which have received
the name of “canals.” Some speculative
minds find in these ground for believing that
they are of artificial origin, and a theory
has been built up, according to which the
so-called canals are “irrigated bands,” the
result of the labours of the inhabitants.
The argument of the advocates of this theory
is put about as follows: Mars is evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>a nearly dried-up planet, and most of the
water left upon it is periodically locked up
in the polar snows. As these snows melt
away in the summer time, now in one hemisphere
and now in the other, the water thus
formed is conducted off toward the tropical
and equatorial zones by innumerable canals,
too small to be seen from the earth. The
lands irrigated by these canals are narrow
strips, whose situation is determined by
local circumstances, and which cross one
another in all directions. Within these
bands, which enlarge into rounded “oases”
where many of them intersect, vegetation
pushes, and its colour causes them to appear
as dark lines and patches on the surface
of the planet. The fact that the lines make
their appearance gradually, after the polar
caps begin to disappear, is regarded as
strongly corroborative of the theory. In
answer to the objection that works so
extensive as this theory of irrigation calls
for would be practically impossible, it is
replied that the relatively small force of
gravity on Mars not only immensely diminishes
the weight of all bodies there, but
also renders it possible for animal forms
to attain a greater size, with corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>increase of muscular power. It is likewise
argued that Mars may have been longer
inhabited than the earth, and that its inhabitants
may consequently have developed
a more complete mastery over the powers
of nature than we as yet possess. Many
astronomers reject these speculations, and
even aver that the lines called “canals”
(and it must be admitted that many powerful
telescopes show few or none of them)
have no real existence, what is seen, or
imagined to be seen, being due to some
peculiarity of the soil, rocks, or atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mars has two small satellites, revolving
round it with great speed at close quarters.
The more distant satellite, Deimos, is 14,600
miles from the centre of Mars and goes
round it in 30 hours, 18 min. The nearer
one, Phobos, is only 5800 miles from the
planet's centre, and its period of revolution
is only 7 hours, 39 min., so that it makes
more than three circuits while the planet
is rotating once on its axis. Both of the
satellites are minute in size, probably under
ten miles in diameter.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'>Beyond Mars, at an average distance of
about 246,000,000 miles from the sun, is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>system of little planets called asteroids.
More than 600 are now known, and new ones
are discovered every year, principally by
means of photography. Only four of these
bodies are of any considerable size, and they
were, naturally, the first to be discovered.
They are Ceres, diameter 477 miles; Pallas,
304 miles; Vesta, 239 miles; and Juno, 120
miles. Many of the others have a diameter
of only about ten, or even, perhaps, as little
as five, miles. Their orbits are more eccentric
than those of any of the large planets,
and one of them, Eros, has a mean distance of
135,000,000 miles, and a least distance of only
105,000,000, so that it is nearer to the sun
than Mars is. Eros may, under favourable
circumstances, approach within 14,000,000
miles of the earth. This fact, as already
mentioned, has been taken advantage of
for measuring its distance from the earth,
from which the distance of the sun may be
calculated with increased accuracy. Eros
and some others of the asteroids seem to be
of an irregular or fragmentary form, and
this has been used to support a theory, which
is not, however, generally accepted, that the
asteroids are the result of an explosion,
by which a larger planet was blown to pieces.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Sixth in order of distance from the sun
(counting the asteroids as representing a
single body) is the greatest of all the planets,
Jupiter. His average distance from the sun
is 483,000,000 miles, but the eccentricity
of his orbit causes him to approach within
472,500,000 miles at perihelion, and to recede
to 493,500,000 miles at aphelion. When
in opposition, Jupiter's mean distance from
the earth is 390,000,000 miles. This gigantic
planet has a mean diameter of 87,380 miles,
but is so flattened at the poles and bulged
round the equator that the polar diameter
is only 84,570 miles, while the equatorial
diameter is 90,190 miles, a difference of
5680 miles. This peculiar form is doubtless
due to the planet's swift rotation. The
axis, like that of Venus, is nearly perpendicular
to the plane of the orbit. He makes a
complete turn on his axis in a mean period
of 9 hours, 55 minutes. The reason for saying
“a mean period” will appear in a moment.
Jupiter's year is equal to 11.86 of our years,
but it comes into opposition to the sun, as
seen from the earth, once in every 399 days.</p>

<p class='c008'>The volume of Jupiter is about 1300 times
that of the earth, <i>i.e.</i> it would take 1300
earths rolled into one to equal Jupiter in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>size. But its mean density is slightly less
than one quarter of the earth's, so that its
mass is only 316 times greater than the
earth's. The force of gravity on its surface
is 2.64 times the earth's. A body weighing
100 pounds on the earth would weigh 264
pounds on Jupiter. It will be observed that
Jupiter's mean density is very nearly the
same as that of the sun, and we conclude that
it cannot be a solid, rigid globe like the earth.
This conclusion is made certain by the fact
that its period of rotation on its axis is
variable, another resemblance to the sun.
The equatorial parts go round in a shorter
period than parts situated some distance
north or south of the equator. It may be
supposed that there is a solid nucleus within,
but if so, no direct evidence of its existence
has been found.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, although Jupiter appears to
be in a cloud-like state, it does not shine
with light of its own, so that its temperature,
while no doubt higher than that of the earth,
cannot approach anywhere near that of the
sun. We do not know of what materials
Jupiter is composed, for spectroscopic analysis
applies especially to bodies which shine
with their own light. When they shine only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>by reflected light received from the sun,
their spectra resemble the regular solar
spectrum, except for the presence of faint
bands due to absorption in the planet's
atmosphere. It may be that there are no
elements of great atomic density, such as
iron or lead, in the globe of Jupiter. Yet
in the course of long ages the planet may
become smaller and more condensed, in
consequence of the escape of its internal
heat. In this way Jupiter may be regarded
as representing an intermediate stage of
evolution between an altogether vaporous
and very hot body like the sun, and a cool
and solid one like the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jupiter presents a magnificent appearance
in a good telescope. Its oblong disk is
seen crossed in an east and west direction,
and parallel to its equator, by broad, vari-coloured
bands, called belts. These frequently
change in form and, to some extent,
in situation, as well as in number. But
there are always at least two wide belts,
one on each side of the equator. In 1878
a very remarkable feature was noticed just
south of the principal south belt of Jupiter,
which has become celebrated under the name
of the Great Red Spot. In a few years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>after its discovery its colour faded, but it
still remains visible, with varying degrees
of distinctness, as an oblong marking, about
30,000 miles long and 7000 miles broad.
The outer border of the great south belt
bends away from the spot, as if some force
of repulsion acted between them, or as if the
spot were an elevation round which the
clouds of the belt flowed like a river round
a projecting headland. The nature of this
curious spot is unknown. Other smaller
spots, sometimes white, sometimes dusky,
occasionally make their appearance, but
they do not exhibit the durability of the
Great Red Spot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jupiter has eight satellites, four of which,
known since the time of Galileo, are conspicuous
objects in the smallest telescope.
All but one of these four are larger than our
moon, while the other four are extremely
insignificant in size. The four principal
satellites are designated by Roman numerals,
I, II, III, IV, arranged in the order of distance
from the planet. They also have names
which are seldom used. Satellite I (Io)
has a diameter of 2452 miles, and revolves
in a period of 1 day, 18 hours, 27 min., 35.5
sec., at a mean distance of 261,000 miles;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>II (Europa) is 2045 miles in diameter,
and revolves in 3 days, 13 hours, 13 min.,
42.1 sec., at a mean distance of 415,000
miles; III (Ganymede) has a diameter of
3558 miles, a period of seven days, 3 hours,
42 min., 33.4 sec., and a mean distance of
664,000 miles; IV (Callisto) is 3345 miles
in diameter, has a period of 16 days, 16 hours,
32 min., 11.2 sec., and a mean distance of
1,167,000 miles. The object of giving the
periods with extreme accuracy will appear
when we speak of the use made of observations
of Jupiter's satellites. The first of
the four small satellites, discovered by
Barnard in 1892, is probably less than 100
miles in diameter, and has a mean distance
of 112,500 miles, and a period of only 11
hours, 57 min., 22.6 sec. The other small
satellites are much more distant than any
of the large ones, the latest to be discovered,
the eighth, being situated at a mean distance
of about 15,000,000 miles, but travelling
in an orbit so eccentric that the distance
ranges between 10,000,000 and 20,000,000
miles. The period is about two and a fifth
years. But the most remarkable fact is
that this satellite revolves round Jupiter
from east to west, a direction contrary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>that pursued by all the others, and contrary
to the direction which is almost universal
among the rotating and revolving bodies of
the solar system.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large satellites are very interesting
objects for the telescope. When they come
between the sun and Jupiter their round black
shadows can be plainly seen moving across
his disk, and when they pass round into his
shadow they are suddenly eclipsed, emerging
after a time out of the other side of the shadow.
These phenomena are known as transits and
eclipses, and their times of occurrence are
carefully predicted in the <i>American Ephemeris
and Nautical Almanac</i>, published at
Washington for the benefit of astronomers
and navigators, because these eclipses can
be employed in comparing local time with
standard meridian time. They were formerly
utilised to determine the velocity of
light, in this way:</p>

<p class='c008'>As the earth goes round its orbit inside
that of Jupiter the latter is seen in opposition
to the sun at intervals of 399 days. When
it is thus seen the earth must be between
the sun and Jupiter, and the distance between
the two planets is the least possible. But
when the earth has passed round to the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>side of the sun from Jupiter this distance
becomes the greatest possible. The increase
of distance between the two planets, as the
earth goes from the nearest to the farthest
side of its orbit, is about 186,000,000 miles.
Now it was noticed by the Danish astronomer,
Roemer, that as the earth moved
farther and farther from Jupiter the times
of occurrence of the eclipses kept getting
later and later, until when the earth arrived
at its greatest distance the eclipses were
about 16 minutes behind time. He correctly
inferred that the retardation of the time was
due to the increase of the distance, and that
the 16 minutes by which the eclipses were
behindhand when the distance was greatest
represented the time taken by light to cross
the 186,000,000 miles of space by which the
earth had increased its distance from Jupiter.
In other words, light must travel 186,000,000
miles in about sixteen minutes, from which
it was easy to calculate its speed per second—which
we now know to be 186,330 miles.
Our knowledge of the velocity of light furnishes
one of the means of calculating the
distance of the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>We come next to the beautiful planet
Saturn, whose mean distance from the sun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>is 886,000,000 miles. The distance varies
between 911,000,000 and 861,000,000 miles.
Saturn's year is equal to 29.46 of our years.
It comes into opposition every 378 days.
The most surprising feature of Saturn is
the system of immense rings surrounding
it above the equator. The globe of the
planet is 76,470 miles in equatorial diameter,
and 69,780 miles in polar diameter, a difference
of 6690 miles, so that Saturn is even
more compressed at the poles and swollen
at the equator than Jupiter. The axis of
rotation is inclined 27° from a perpendicular.
The rings are three in number, very thin
in proportion to their vast size, and placed
one within another in the same plane. The
outer diameter of the outer ring, called Ring
A, is about 168,000 miles. Its breadth is
about 10,000 miles. Then comes a gap,
about 1600 miles across, separating it from
Ring B, the brightest of the set. This is
about 16,500 miles broad, and at its inner
edge it gradually fades out, blending with
Ring C, which is called the crape, or gauze,
ring, because it has a dusky appearance,
and is so translucent that the globe of the
planet can be seen through it. This ring is
about 10,000 miles broad, and its inner edge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>comes within a distance of between 9000
and 10,000 miles of the surface of the planet.
Ring A apparently has a very narrow gap
running round at about a third of its breadth
from the outer edge. This, known as
Encke's Division, is not equally plain at all
times. Occasionally observers report the
temporary appearance of other thin gaps.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mean density of Saturn is less than
that of any other planet, being but 0.13 that
of the earth, or 0.72 that of water. It
follows that this great planet would float in
water. The weight of bodies at its surface
would be a little less than three-quarters
of their weight on the surface of the earth.
The globe of Saturn, like that of Jupiter,
is marked by belts parallel with the equator,
but they are less definite in outline and less
conspicuous than the belts of Jupiter. The
equatorial zone often shows a beautiful pale
salmon tint, while the regions round the
poles are faintly bluish. Light spots are
occasionally seen upon the planet, and it
appears to rotate more rapidly at the equator
than in the higher latitudes. There seems
to be every reason to think that Saturn,
also, is of a vaporous constitution, although
it may have a relatively condensed nucleus.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>But while the globe of the planet appears
to be vaporous, the same is not true of the
rings. We have already mentioned the fact
that they are exceedingly thin in proportion
to their great size and width. The thickness
has not been determined with exactness,
but it probably does not exceed, on the average,
one hundred miles. There appear to be
portions of the rings which are thicker than
the average, as if the matter of which they
are composed were heaped up there. This
matter evidently consists of an innumerable
multitude of small bodies. In other words,
the rings are composed of swarms of what
may be called meteors. That their composition
must be of this nature, although
the telescope does not reveal it, has been
proved in two ways: first, by mathematical
calculation, which shows that if the rings
were all of a piece, whether solid or liquid,
they would be destroyed by the contending
forces of attraction to which they are subject;
and, second, by spectroscopic observation,
which proves, in a way that will be shown
when we come to deal with the stars, that
the rings rotate with velocities proportional
to the distances of their various parts from
the centre of the planet. Hence it is inferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>that they must consist of a vast number
of small bodies or particles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Saturn has ten satellites, all revolving
outside the rings. The names of nine of
these in the order of increasing distance are:
Mimas, distance 117,000 miles; Enceladus,
distance 157,000 miles; Tethys, distance
186,000 miles; Dione, distance 238,000 miles;
Rhea, distance 332,000 miles; Titan, distance
771,000 miles; Hyperion, distance
934,000 miles; Japetus, distance 2,225,000
miles; and Phœbe, distance 8,000,000 miles.
The last, like the eighth satellite of Jupiter,
revolves in a retrograde direction. Only
Titan and Japetus are conspicuous objects.
The period of Mimas is only about
22½ hours; that of Titan is 15 days, 22
hours, 41 min., and that of Japetus about
79 days, 8 hours. Barnard's measurements
indicate for Titan a diameter of 2720 miles.
Japetus is probably about two-thirds as
great in diameter as Titan.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Beyond Saturn, in the order named, are
Uranus and Neptune. The mean distance
of the former from the sun is 1,782,000,000
miles, and that of the latter 2,791,500,000
miles. The orbit of Uranus is more eccentric
than that of Neptune. The diameter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Uranus is about 32,000 miles and that of
Neptune about 35,000 miles. The year of
Uranus is equal to 84 of our years, and that
of Neptune to 164.78. These planets are
so remote, and so poorly illuminated by the
sun, that the telescope reveals very little
detail on their surfaces. Their density is
somewhat less than that of Jupiter. Uranus
has four satellites, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and
Oberon, situated at the respective distances
of 120,000, 167,000, 273,000, and 365,000
miles. Neptune has one, nameless, satellite,
at a distance of 225,000 miles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most remarkable thing about these
two planets is that their axes of rotation,
as compared with those of all the other
planets, are tipped over into a different
plane, so that they rotate in a retrograde
or backward direction, and their satellites,
in like manner, revolve from east to west.
The axis of Uranus is not far from upright
to the plane of the ecliptic, so that the motion
of its satellites carries them alternately far
northward and far southward of that plane,
but the axis of Neptune is tipped so far over
that the retrograde, or east to west, motion
is very pronounced. Neptune is celebrated
for having been discovered by means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>mathematical calculations, based on its disturbing
attraction on Uranus. These calculations
showed where it ought to be at
a certain time, and when telescopes were
pointed at the indicated spot the planet was
found. Similar disturbances of the motions
of Neptune lead some astronomers to think
that there is another, yet undiscovered,
planet still more distant.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. <b>Comets.</b> Comets are the most extraordinary
in appearance of all celestial
objects visible to the naked eye. Great
comets have been regarded with terror and
superstitious dread in all ages of the world,
wherever ignorance of their nature has
prevailed. They have been taken for prognosticators
of wars, famines, plagues, the
death of rulers, the outbreak of revolutions,
and the subversion of empires. One reason
for this, aside from their strange and menacing
appearance, is, no doubt, the rarity
of very great and conspicuous comets. It
was not until Newton had demonstrated the
law of gravitation that the fact began to be
recognised that comets are controlled in their
motions by the sun. We now know that
they travel in orbits, frequently, and perhaps
always, elliptical, having the sun in one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the foci. Comets are habitually divided
into two classes: first, periodical comets,
meaning those which have been observed
at more than one return to perihelion; and,
second, non-periodical comets, meaning those
which have been seen but once, but which,
nevertheless, may return to perihelion in a
period so long that a second return has not
been observed. A better division is into
comets of short period, and comets of long,
or unknown, periods.</p>

<div id='i203'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i203.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 17. Ellipse, Parabola, and Hyperbola.</i><br /><br />The figure shows graphically why it is so difficult to tell exactly the form of a comet's orbit. The three kinds of curves are nearly of the same form near the focus (the Sun), and it is only in that part of its orbit that the comet can be seen. Moreover a comet is, at best, a misty and indefinite object, which renders it so much the more difficult to obtain good observations of its precise position and movement.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Still, many astronomers are disposed to
think that the majority of comets do not
travel in elliptical but in parabolic, and a
few in hyperbolic, orbits. This calls for a few
words of explanation. Ellipses, parabolas,
and hyperbolas are all conic-section curves,
but the ellipse alone returns into itself, or
forms a closed circuit. In each case the sun
is situated at the focus where the perihelion,
or nearest approach, of the comet occurs,
but only comets travelling in elliptical
orbits return again after having once been
seen. A comet moving in a parabola would
go back into the depths of space nearly in
the direction from which it had come, and
would never be seen again; and if it moved in
a hyperbola it would go off toward another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>quarter of the celestial sphere, and likewise
would never return. Now it is true that
the forms calculated for the orbits of the
majority of comets that have been observed
appear to be parabolic (a very few seem
to be hyperbolic), and if this is the fact such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>comets cannot be permanent members of
the solar system, but must enter it from far-off
regions of space, and having visited the
sun must return to such regions without any
tendency to come back again. In that case
they may pay similar visits to other suns.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is quite possible that what appear
to be parabolic orbits may, in reality, be
ellipses of very great eccentricity. The
difficulty in determining the precise shape of
a comet's orbit arises from the fact that all
three of the curves just mentioned closely
approximate to one another in the neighbourhood
of their common focus, the sun,
and it is only in that part of their orbits
that comets are visible. The whole question
is yet in abeyance, but, as we have said,
it seems likely that all comets really move
in elliptical orbits, and consequently never
get entirely beyond the control of the sun's
attraction. But in all cases the orbits of
comets are much more eccentric than those
of the large planets. The famous comet of
Halley, for instance, which has the longest
period of any of the known periodical class,
about seventy-five years, is 3,293,000,000
miles from the sun when in aphelion, and
only 54,770,000 miles when in perihelion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Comets, when near the sun, are greatly
affected by the disturbing attraction of
large planets, and especially of the most
massive of them all, Jupiter. The effect of
this disturbance is to change the form of
their orbits, with the not infrequent result
that the latter are altered from apparent
parabolas into unquestionable ellipses, and
thus the comets concerned are said to be
“captured,” or made prisoners to the sun,
by the influence of the disturbing planet.
About twenty small comets are known as
“Jupiter's Comet Family,” because they
appear to have been “captured” in this way
by him. A few others are believed to have
been similarly captured by Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune.</p>

<p class='c008'>The orbits of comets differ from those of
the planets in other ways beside their greater
eccentricity. The planets all move round the
sun from west to east, but comets move in
both directions. The orbits of the planets,
with the exception of some of the asteroids,
all lie near one common plane, but those of
comets are inclined at all angles to this plane,
some of them coming down from the north
side of the ecliptic and others up from the
south side.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>A comet consists of two distinct portions:
first, the head, or nucleus; and, second, the
tail. The latter only makes its appearance
when the comet is drawing near the sun, and,
as a whole, it is always directed away from
the sun, but usually more or less curved
backward along the comet's course, as if
the head tended to run away from it. The
appearance of a comet's tail at once suggests
that it is produced by some repulsive force
emanating from the sun. Recently there
has been a tendency to explain this on the
principle of what is known as the pressure
of light. This demands a brief explanation.
Light is believed to be a disturbance of the
universal ether in the form of waves which
proceed from the luminous body. These
waves possess a certain mechanical energy
tending to drive away bodies upon which
they impinge. The energy is relatively
slight, and in ordinary circumstances produces
no perceptible effect, but when the
body acted upon by the light is extremely
small the pressure may become so great
relatively to gravitation as to prevail over
the latter. To illustrate this, let us recall
two facts—first, that gravitation acts upon
the mass, <i>i.e.</i> all the particles of a body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>throughout its entire volume; and, second,
that pressure acts only upon the exterior
surface. Consequently gravitation is proportional
to the volume, while the pressure
of light is proportional to the surface of
the body acted upon. Now the mass, or
volume, of any body varies as the cube of
its diameter, and the surface only as the
square. If, then, we have two bodies, one
of which has twice the diameter of the
other, the mass of the second will be eight
times less than that of the first, but the
surface will be only four times less. If the
second has only one-third the diameter of
the first, then its mass will be twenty-seven
times less, but its surface only nine times
less. Thus we see that as we diminish the
size of the body, the mass falls off more
rapidly than the area of the surface, and
consequently the pressure gains relatively
to the gravitation. Experiment has corroborated
the conclusions of mathematics
on this subject, and has shown that when a
particle of matter is only about one one-hundred-thousandth
of an inch in diameter
the pressure of light upon it becomes greater
than the force of gravitation, and such a
particle, situated in open space, would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>driven away from the sun by the light
waves. This critical size would vary with
the density of the matter composing the
particle, but what we have said will serve to
convey an idea of its minuteness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now in applying this to comets' tails
it is only necessary to remark that they are
composed of either gaseous or dusty particles,
or both, rising from the nucleus, probably
under the influence of the heat or the electrical
action of the sun, and these particles, being
below the critical size, are driven away from
the sun, and appear in the form of a tail
following the comet. It may be added that
the same principle has been evoked to explain
the corona of the sun, which may be
composed of clouds of gas or dust kept in
suspension by the pressure of light.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nuclei of comets contain nearly
their whole mass. The actual mass of no
comet is known, but it can in no case be very
great. Moreover, it is probable that the
nucleus of a comet does not consist of a
single body, either solid or liquid, but is
composed of a large number of separate
small bodies, like a flock of meteors, crowded
together and constantly impinging upon one
another. As the comet approaches the sun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the nucleus becomes violently agitated, and
then the tail begins to make its appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The possibility exists of an encounter
between the earth and the head of a comet,
but no such occurrence is known. Two or
three times, however, the earth is believed
to have gone through the tail of a comet,
the last time in 1910, when Halley's comet
passed between the earth and the sun,
but no certain effects have been observed
from such encounters. The spectroscope
shows that comets contain various hydrocarbons,
sodium, nitrogen, magnesium, and
possibly iron, but we know, as yet, very
little about their composition. The presence
of cyanogen gas was reported in Halley's
comet at its last appearance. We are still
more ignorant of the origin of comets. We
do know, however, that they tend to go to
pieces, especially those which approach very
close to the sun. The great comet of 1882,
which almost grazed the sun, was afterward
seen retreating into space scattered into
several parts, each provided with a tail.
In at least one case, several comets have
been found travelling in the same track,
an indication that one large original comet
has been separated into three or four smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>ones. This appears to be true of the comets
of 1843, 1880, and 1882,—and perhaps the
comet of 1576 should be added. But the
most remarkable case of disruption is that of
Biela's Comet, which first divided into two
parts in 1846 and then apparently became
scattered into a swarm of meteors which was
encountered by the earth in 1872, when it
passed near the old track of the comet.
This leads us to our next subject.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>8. Meteors.</b> Everybody must, at some
time, have beheld the phenomenon known as
a falling, or shooting, star. A few of these
objects can be seen darting across the sky
on almost any clear night in the course of
an hour or two of watching. Sometimes
they appear more numerously, and at intervals
they are seen in “showers.” They
are called meteors, and it is believed that
they are minute solid bodies, perhaps averaging
but a small fraction of an ounce in
weight, which plunge into the atmosphere
with velocities varying from twenty to
thirty or more miles per second, and are
set afire and consumed by the heat of friction
developed by their rush through the air.
Anybody who has seen a bullet melted by
the heat suddenly developed when it strikes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>a steel target has had a graphic illustration
of the transformation of motion into heat.
But if we could make the bullet move fast
enough it would <i>melt in the air</i>, the heat
being developed by the constant friction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The connection of meteors with comets
is very interesting. In the year 1833, a
magnificent and imposing display of meteors,
which, for hours, on the night between the
13th and 14th of November, filled the sky
with fire-balls and flaming streaks, astonished
all beholders and filled many with terror.
It was found that these meteors travelled
in an orbit intersecting that of the earth at
the point where the latter arrived in the
middle of November, and also that they had
a period of revolution about the sun of 33¼
years, and were so far scattered along their
orbit that they required nearly three years
to pass the point of intersection with the
orbit of the earth. Thus it was concluded
that for three years in succession, in mid-November,
there should be a display of the
meteors plunging into the earth's atmosphere.
But only in the year when the
thickest part of the swarm was encountered
by the earth would the display be very
imposing. Upon this it was predicted that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>there would be a recurrence of the phenomenon
of 1833 in the year 1866. It happened as
predicted, except that the number of meteors
was not quite so great as before. In the
meantime, it had been discovered that these
meteors followed in the track of a comet
known as Temple's Comet, and also that
certain other meteors, which appear every
year in considerable numbers about the 10th
of August, followed the track of another
comet called Tuttle's Comet. Then in
1872 came the display, mentioned in the
last section, of meteors which were evidently
the debris of the vanished comet of Biela.
The inference from so many similar cases
was irresistible that the meteors must be
fragments of destroyed or partially destroyed
comets. Several other cases of identity of
orbits between meteors and comets have
been discovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been said that the August meteors
appear every year. The explanation of this
is that they have, in the course of many
ages, been scattered around the whole circuit
of their orbit, so that each year, about
the 10th of August, when the earth crosses
their track, some of the meteors are encountered.
They are like an endless railroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>train travelling upon a circular track.
The November meteors also appear, in small
numbers, every year, a fact indicating that
some of them, too, have been scattered all
around their orbit, although the great mass
of them is still concentrated in an elongated
swarm, and a notable display can only occur
when this swarm is at the crossing simultaneously
with the earth. These meteors
were eagerly awaited in 1899, when it was
hoped that the splendid displays of 1833 and
1866 might be repeated, but, unfortunately,
in the meantime the planets Jupiter and
Saturn, by their disturbing attractions, had
so altered the position of the path of the
meteors in space that the principal swarm
missed the connection. There are many
other periodical meteor showers, generally
less brilliant than those already mentioned,
and some astronomers think that all of them
had their origin from comets.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not known that any meteor from any
of these swarms has ever reached the surface
of the earth. The meteors appear to be so
small that they are entirely burnt up before
they can get through the atmosphere, which
thus acts as a shield against these little
missiles from outer space. But there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>another class of meteoric bodies, variously
known as meteorites, aërolites, uranoliths, or
bolides, which consists of larger masses,
and these sometimes fall upon the earth,
after a fiery passage through the air.
Specimens of them may be seen in many
museums. They are divided into two
principal classes, according to their composition:
first, stony meteorites, which are by
far the most numerous; and, second, iron
meteorites, which consist of almost pure iron,
generally alloyed with a little nickel. The
stony meteorites, which usually contain
some compound of iron, consist of a great
variety of substances, including between
twenty and thirty different chemical elements.
Although they resemble in many ways
minerals of volcanic origin on the earth,
they also possess certain characteristics by
which they can be recognised even when
they have not been seen to fall.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a meteorite passes through the air
it makes a brilliant display of light, and
frequently bursts asunder, with a tremendous
noise, scattering its fragments about. The
largest fragment of a meteorite actually
seen to fall, weighs about a quarter of a ton.
Upon striking the ground the meteorite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>sometimes penetrates to a depth of several
feet, and some have been picked up which
were yet hot on the surface, although very
cold within. It is not known that meteorites
have any connection with comets, and their
origin can only be conjectured. Among
the various suggestions that have been made
the following may be mentioned: (1) that
they have been shot out of the sun—particularly
the iron meteorites; (2) that they
were cast into space by lunar volcanoes
when the moon was still subject to volcanic
action; (3) that they are the products
of explosion in the stars. But some astronomers
are disposed to think that they
originated in a similar manner to other
members of the solar system, although it is
difficult, on this hypothesis, to account for
their great density. The opinion that the
iron meteorites have come from the sun,
or some other star, is enforced by the fact
that they contain hydrogen, carbon, and
helium, in forms suggesting that these gases
were absorbed while the bodies were immersed
in a hot, dense atmosphere.</p>

</div>
<p class='c007'><b>1. The Stars.</b> The stars are distant
suns, varying greatly in remoteness, in
magnitude, and in condition. Many of
them are much smaller than our sun, and
many others are as much larger. They vary,
likewise in age, or state of development.
Some are relatively young, others in a
middle stage, and still others in a condition
that may be called solar decrepitude.
These proofs of evolution among the stars,
the knowledge of which we owe mainly
to spectroscopic analysis, serve to establish
more firmly the conclusion, to which the
simple aspect of the heavens first leads us,
that the universe is a connected system,
governed everywhere by similar laws and
consisting of like materials.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of stars visible to the naked
eye is about six thousand, but telescopes show
tens of millions. It is customary to divide the
stars into classes, called magnitudes, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to their apparent brightness. By a
system of photometry, or light-measurement,
they are grouped into stars of the first,
second, third, etc., magnitude. With the
naked eye no stars fainter than the sixth
magnitude are visible, but very powerful
telescopes may show them down to the
eighteenth magnitude. Each magnitude is
about two and a half times brighter than the
next magnitude below in the scale. A first-magnitude
star is about one hundred times
brighter than one of the sixth magnitude.
But, in reality, the variation of brightness
is gradual, and for very accurate estimates
fractions of a magnitude have to be employed.
There are about twenty first-magnitude stars,
but they are not all of equal brightness.
A more accurate photometry assumes a
zero magnitude, very nearly, represented
by the star Arcturus, and makes the ratio
2.512. Thus a star, nearly represented by
Aldebaran or Altair, which is 2.512 times
fainter than the zero magnitude, is of the
first magnitude, and a star, nearly represented
by the North Star, which is 2.512
times fainter than the first magnitude, is of
the second magnitude. Counting in the
other direction, a star, like Sirius, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>brighter than the zero magnitude, is said to
be of a negative magnitude. The magnitude
of Sirius is—1.6. There is only one other
star of negative magnitude, Canopus, whose
magnitude is—0.9. But for ordinary purposes
one need not trouble himself with these
refinements.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The stars are divided into five principal
types, according to their spectra. These
are:</p>

<p class='c008'>I. White stars, having a bluish tinge, in
which the spectrum is characterised by broad
dark bands, due apparently to an extensive
atmosphere of hydrogen, while there are
but few lines indicating the presence of
metallic vapours. About half the stars
whose spectra have been studied belong to
Type I.</p>

<p class='c008'>II. Yellowish-white stars, resembling the
sun in having their spectra crossed with a
great number of lines produced by metallic
vapours, while the hydrogen lines are less
conspicuous. These are often called solar
stars, and they, too, are very numerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>III. Orange and slightly reddish stars,
whose spectra contain mostly broad bands
instead of narrow lines, the bands being
situated toward the blue end of the spectrum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>whence the prevailing colour, since the blue
light is thus cut off. Only a few hundred
of these stars are known, but they include
most of the well-known variable stars.</p>

<p class='c008'>IV. Small deep-red stars having dark
bands absorbing the light of the red end of
the spectrum. Less than a hundred of
these stars are known.</p>

<p class='c008'>V. Stars whose spectra are characterised
by bright instead of dark lines, although
they also show dark bands. The bright
lines indicate that the atmospheric vapours
producing them are at a higher temperature
than the body of the star. Stars of this
type are sometimes called Wolf-Rayet stars
and they are few in number.</p>

<p class='c008'>Various modifications of these main types
exist, but we cannot here enter into an
account of them. In a general way, although
there are exceptions depending upon
the precise nature of each spectrum, the
white stars are thought to be younger than
the yellowish ones, and the red stars older.</p>

<p class='c008'>In speaking of the “size” of the stars we
really mean their luminosity, or the amount
of light radiated from them. When a star
is said to be a thousand times greater than
the sun, the meaning is that the amount of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>light that it gives would, if both were viewed
from the same distance, be equal to a
thousand times the amount given by the
sun. We have no direct knowledge of the
actual size of the stars as globes, because
the most powerful telescope is unable to
reveal the real disk of a star. In comparing
the luminosity of a star with that of the sun
its distance must be taken into account.
Most of the stars are so far away that we
really know nothing of their distances, but
there are fifty or more which lie within a
distance not too great to enable us to obtain
an approximate idea of what it is. The
nearest star in the northern sky is so far
from being the brightest that it can barely
be seen with the naked eye. It must be
very much less luminous than the sun. On
the other hand, some very bright stars lie
at a distance so immense that it can hardly
be estimated, and they must exceed the sun
in luminosity hundreds and even thousands
of times.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question of the distance of the stars
has already been treated in the section on
Parallax. In employing our knowledge of
star distances for the purpose of comparing
their luminosity with that of the sun, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>must first ascertain, as accurately as possible,
the actual amount of light that the star
sends to the earth as compared with the
actual amount of light that the sun sends.
The star Arcturus gives to our eyes about
one forty-billionth as much light as the sun
does. Knowing this, we must remember
that the intensity of light varies, like gravitation,
inversely as the square of the distance.
Thus, if the sun were twice as far away as it
is, the amount of its light received on the
earth would be reduced to one fourth, and
if its distance were increased three times, the
amount would be reduced to one ninth.
If the sun were 200,000 times as far away,
its light would be reduced to one forty-billionth,
or the same as that of Arcturus.
At this point the actual distance of Arcturus
enters into the calculation. If that distance
were 200,000 times the sun's distance, we
should have to conclude that Arcturus
was exactly equal to the sun in luminosity,
since the sun, if removed to the same distance,
would give us the same amount of light.
But, in fact, we find that the distance of
Arcturus, instead of being 200,000 times that
of the sun, is about 10,000,000 times. In
other words, it is fifty times as far away as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the sun would have to be in order that it
should appear to our eyes no brighter than
Arcturus. From this it follows that the
real luminosity of Arcturus must be the
square of 50, or 2500, times that of the sun.
In the same manner we find that Sirius,
which to the eye appears to be the brightest
star in the sky (much brighter than Arcturus
because much nearer), is about thirty times
as luminous as the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the stars are changeable in
brightness, and those in which the changes
occur to a notable extent, and periodically,
are known as variable stars. It is probable
that all the stars, including the sun, are
variable to a slight degree. Among the
most remarkable variables are Mira, or
Omicron Ceti, in the constellation Cetus,
which in the course of about 331 days rises
from the ninth to the third magnitude and
then falls back again (the maxima of brightness
are irregular); and Algol, or Beta Persei,
in the constellation Perseus, which, in a
period of 2 days, 20 hours, 49 minutes,
changes from the third to the second magnitude
and back again. In the case of Mira
the cause of the changes is believed to lie
in the star itself, and they may be connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>with its gradual extinction. The majority
of the variable stars belong to this class.
As to Algol, the variability is apparently
due to a huge dark body circling close around
the star with great speed, and periodically
producing partial eclipses of its light. There
are a few other stars with short periods of
variability which belong to the class of Algol.</p>

<p class='c008'>When examined with telescopes many of
the stars are found to be double, triple, or
multiple. Often this arises simply from the
fact that two or more happen to lie in nearly
the same line of sight from the earth, but
in many other cases it is found that there
is a real connection, and that the stars concerned
revolve, under the influence of their
mutual gravitation, round a common centre
of force. When two stars are thus connected
they are called a binary. The periods of
revolution range from fifty to several
hundred years. Among the most celebrated
binary stars are Alpha Centauri, in the
southern hemisphere, the nearest known
star to the solar system, whose components
revolve in a period of about eighty years;
Gamma Virginis, in the constellation Virgo,
period about one hundred and seventy years;
and Sirius, period about fifty-three years.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>In the case of Sirius, one of the components,
although perhaps half as massive as its companion,
is ten thousand times less bright.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is another class of binary stars,
in which one of the companions is invisible,
its presence being indicated by the effects
of its gravitational pull upon the other.
Algol may be regarded as an example of
this kind of stellar association. But there
are stars of this class, where the companion
causes no eclipses, either because it is not
dark, or because it never passes over the
other, as seen from the earth, but where its
existence is proved, in a very interesting way,
by the spectroscope. In these stars, called
spectroscopic binaries, two bright components
are so close together that no telescope is
able to make them separately visible, but
when their plane of revolution lies nearly
in our line of sight the lines in their combined
spectrum are seen periodically split asunder.
To understand this, we must recall the
principles underlying spectroscopic analysis
and add something to what was said before
on that subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Light consists of waves in the ether of
different lengths and making upon the eye
different impressions of colour according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>to the length of the waves. The longest
waves are at the red end of the spectrum
and the shortest at the blue, or violet, end.
But since they all move onward with the
same speed, it is clear that the short blue
waves must fall in quicker succession on
the retina of the eye than the long red waves.
Now suppose that the source of light from
which the waves come is approaching very
swiftly; it is easy to see that all the waves
will strike the eye with greater rapidity,
and that the whole spectrum will be shifted
toward the blue, or short-wave, end. The
Fraunhofer lines will share in this shifting
of position. Next suppose that the source
of the light is retreating from the eye. The
same effect will occur in a reversed sense,
for now there will be a general shift toward
the red end of the spectrum. A sufficiently
clear illustration, by analogy, is furnished
by the waves of sound. We know that
low-pitched sounds are produced by long
waves, and high-pitched ones by short waves;
then if the source of the sound, such as a
locomotive whistle, rapidly approaches the
ear the waves are crowded together, or
shifted as a whole toward the short end of
the gamut, whereupon the sound rises to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>shrill scream. If, on the contrary, the
source of sound is retreating, the shift is in
the other direction, and the sound drops
to a lower pitch.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is precisely what happens in the
spectrum of a star which is either approaching
or receding from the eye. If it is approaching,
the Fraunhofer lines are seen
shifted out of their normal position toward
the blue, and if it is receding they are shifted
toward the red. The amount of shifting
will depend upon the speed of the star's
motion. If that motion is across the line
of sight there will be no shifting, because
then the source of light is neither approaching
nor receding. Now take the case of a binary
star whose components are too close to be
separated by a telescope. If they happen
to be revolving round their common centre
in a plane nearly coinciding with the line
of sight from the earth, one of them must
be approaching the eye at the same time that
the other is receding from it, and the consequence
is that the spectral lines of the first
will be shifted toward the blue, while those
of the second are shifted toward the red.
The colours of the two intermingled spectra
blend into each other too gradually to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>enable this effect to be detected by their
means, but the Fraunhofer lines are sharply
defined, and in them the shift is clearly seen;
and since there is a simultaneous shifting
in opposite directions the lines appear split.
But when the two stars are in that part
of their orbit where their common motion is
across the line of sight the lines close up
again, because then there is no shift. This
phenomenon is beautifully exhibited by one
of the first spectroscopic binaries to be discovered,
Beta Aurigæ. In 1889, Prof. E.
C. Pickering noticed that the spectral lines
of this star appeared split every second night,
from which he inferred that it consisted of
two stars revolving round a common centre
in a period of four days.</p>

<p class='c008'>This spectroscopic method has been applied
to determine the speed with which certain
single stars are approaching or receding
from the solar system. It has also served
to show, what we have before remarked,
that the inner parts of Saturn's rings travel
faster than the outer parts. Moreover, it
has been used in measuring the rate of the
sun's rotation on its axis, for it is plain that
one edge of the sun approaches us while
the opposite edge is receding. Even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>effect of the rotation of Jupiter has been
revealed in this way, and the same method
will probably settle the question whether
Venus rotates rapidly, or keeps the same face
always toward the sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only do many stars revolve in orbits
about near-by companions, but all the stars,
without exception, are independently in
motion. They appear to be travelling
through space in many different directions,
each following its own chosen way without
regard to the others, and each moving at its
own gait. These movements of the stars
are called proper motions. The direction
of the sun's proper motion is, roughly speaking,
northward, and it travels at the rate of
twelve or fourteen miles per second, carrying
the earth and the other planets along
with it. Some stars have a much greater
speed than the sun, and some a less speed.
As we have said, these motions are in many
different directions, and no attempt to
discover any common law underlying them
has been entirely successful, although it has
been found that in some parts of the sky
a certain number of stars appear to be
travelling along nearly parallel paths, like
flocks of migrating birds. In recent years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>some indications have been found of the
possible existence of two great general currents
of movement, almost directly opposed to
each other, part of the stars following one
current and part the other. But no indication
has been discovered of the existence
of any common centre of motion. Several
relatively near-by stars appear to be moving
in the same direction as the sun. Stars
that are closely grouped together, like the
cluster of the Pleiades, seem to share a
common motion of translation through
space. We have already remarked that
when stars are found to be moving toward
or away from the sun, spectroscopic observation
of the shifting of their lines gives a
means of calculating their velocity. In
other cases, the velocity across the line of
sight can be calculated if we know the
distance of the stars concerned. One interesting
result of the fact that the earth
goes along with the sun in its flight is that
the orbit of the earth cannot be a closed
curve, but must have the form of a spiral
in space. In consequence of this we are
continually advancing, at the rate of at
least 400,000,000 miles per year, toward the
northern quarter of the sky. The path
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>pursued by the sun appears to be straight,
although it may, in fact, be a curve so large
that we are unable in the course of a lifetime,
or many lifetimes, to detect its departure
from a direct line. At any rate we know
that, as the earth accompanies the sun,
we are continually moving into new regions
of space.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been stated that many millions of
stars are visible with telescopes—perhaps
a hundred millions, or even more. The
great majority of these are found in a broad
irregular band, extending entirely round the
sky, and called the Milky Way, or the
Galaxy. To the naked eye the Milky Way
appears as a softly shining baldric encircling
the heavens, but the telescope shows that
it consists of multitudes of faint stars,
whose minuteness is probably mainly due
to the immensity of their distance, although
it may be partly a result of their relative
lack of actual size, or luminosity. In many
parts of the Milky Way the stars appear
so crowded that they present the appearance
of sparkling clouds. The photographs of
these aggregations of stars in the Milky
Way, made by Barnard, are marvellous
beyond description. In the Milky Way, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>sometimes outside it, there exist globular
star-clusters, in which the stars seem so
crowded toward the centre that it is impossible
to separate them with a telescope,
and the effect is that of a glistering ball
made up of thousands of silvery particles,
like a heap of microscopic thermometer
bulbs in the sunshine. A famous cluster
of this kind is found in the constellation
Hercules.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Milky Way evidently has the form
of a vast wreath, made up of many interlaced
branches, some of which extend considerably
beyond its mean borders. Within, this
starry wreath space is relatively empty of
stars, although some thousands do exist
there, of which the sun is one. We are at
present situated not very far from the centre
of the opening within the ring or wreath, but
the proper motion of the sun is carrying us
across this comparatively open space, and in
the course of time, if the direction of our
motion does not change, we shall arrive at
a point not far from its northern border.
The Milky Way probably indicates the
general plan on which the visible universe
is constructed, or what has been called the
architecture of the heavens, but we still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>know too little of this plan to be able to say
exactly what it is.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of stars in existence at any
time varies to a slight degree, for occasionally
a star disappears, or a new one makes
its appearance. These, however, are rare
phenomena, and new stars usually disappear
or fade away after a short time, for which
reason they are often called temporary stars.
The greatest of these phenomena ever beheld
was Tycho Brahe's star, which suddenly
burst into view in the constellation Cassiopeia
in 1572, and disappeared after a couple of
years, although at first it was the brightest
star in the heavens. Another temporary
star, nearly as brilliant, appeared in the
constellation Perseus, in 1901, and this, as
it faded, gradually turned into a nebula,
or a star surrounded by a nebula. It is
generally thought that outbursts of this
kind are caused by the collision of two or
more massive bodies, which were invisible
before their disastrous encounter in space.
The heat developed by such a collision would
be sufficient to vaporise them, and thus to
produce the appearance of a new blazing
star. It is possible that space contains an
enormous number of great obscure bodies,—extinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>suns, perhaps—which are
moving in all directions as rapidly as the
visible stars.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>2. The Nebulæ.</b> These objects, which get
their name from their cloud-like appearance,
are among the most puzzling phenomena of
the heavens, although they seem to suggest
a means of explaining the origin of stars.
Many thousands of nebulæ are known, but
there are only two or three bright enough to
be visible to the naked eye. One of these
is in the “sword” of the imaginary giant
figure marking the constellation Orion, and
another is in the constellation Andromeda.
They look to the unaided eye like misty
specks, and require considerable attention
to be seen at all. But in telescopes their
appearance is marvellous. The Orion nebula
is a broad, irregular cloud, with many brighter
points, and a considerable number of stars
intermingled with it, while the Andromeda
nebula has a long spindle shape, with a
brighter spot in the centre. It is covered
and surrounded with multitudes of faint
stars. It was only after astronomical photography
had been perfected that the real
shapes of the nebulæ were clearly revealed.
Thousands of nebulæ have been discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>by photography, which are barely if at
all visible to the eye, even when aided
by powerful telescopes. This arises from
the fact that the sensitive photographic
plate accumulates the impression that the
light makes upon it, showing more and more
the longer it is exposed. Plates placed in
the focus of telescopes, arranged to utilise
specially the “photographic rays,” are often
exposed for many hours on end in order to
picture faint nebulæ and faint stars, so
that they reveal things that the eye, which
sees all it can see at a glance, is unable
to perceive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nebulæ are generally divided into two
classes—the “white” nebulæ and the “green”
nebulæ. The first, of which the Andromeda
nebula is a striking example, give a continuous
spectrum without dark lines, as if
they consisted either of gas under high
pressure, or of something in a solid or liquid
state. The second, conspicuously represented
by the Orion nebula, give a spectrum
consisting of a few bright lines, characteristic
of such gases as hydrogen and helium,
together with other substances not yet
recognised. But there is no continuous
spectrum like that shown by the white nebulæ,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>from which it is inferred that the green
nebulæ, at least, are wholly gaseous in
their constitution. The precise constitution
of the white nebulæ remains to be determined.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is only in relatively recent years that
the fact has become known that the majority
of nebulæ have a spiral form. There is
almost invariably a central condensed mass
from which great spiral arms wind away on
all sides, giving to many of them the appearance
of spinning pin-wheels, flinging
off streams of fire and sparks on all sides.
The spirals look as if they were gaseous,
but along and in them are arrayed many
condensed knots, and frequently curving
rows of faint stars are seen apparently in
continuation of the nebulous spirals. The
suggestion conveyed is that the stars have
been formed by condensation from the spirals.
These nebulæ generally give the spectra
of the white class, but there are also sometimes
seen bright lines due to glowing gases.
The Andromeda nebula is sometimes described
as spiral, but its aspect is rather
that of a great central mass surrounded with
immense elliptical rings, some of which have
broken up and are condensing into separate
masses. The Orion nebula is a chaotic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>cloud, filled with partial vacancies and ribbed
with many curving, wave-like forms.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are other nebulæ which have the
form of elliptical rings, occasionally with one
or more stars near the centre. A famous
example of this kind is found in the constellation
Lyra. Still others have been compared
in shape to the planet Saturn with its rings,
and some are altogether bizarre in form,
occasionally looking like glowing tresses
floating among the stars.</p>

<p class='c008'>The apparent association of nebulæ with
stars led to the so-called nebular hypothesis,
according to which stars are formed, as
already suggested, by the condensation of
nebulous matter. In the celebrated form
which Laplace gave to this hypothesis, it was
concerned specially with the origin of our solar
system. He assumed that the sun was once
enormously expanded, in a nebulous state, or
surrounded with a nebulous cloud, and that
as it contracted rings were left off around
the periphery of the vast rotating mass.
These rings subsequently breaking and condensing
into globes, were supposed to have
given rise to the planets. It is still believed
that the sun and the other stars may have
originated from the condensation of nebulæ,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>but many objections have been found to the
form in which Laplace put his hypothesis,
and the discovery of the spiral nebulæ has
led to other conjectures concerning the way
in which the transformation is brought
about. But we have not here the space to
enter into this discussion, although it is of
fascinating interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>A word more should be said about the use
of photography in astronomy. It is hardly
going too far to aver that the photographic
plate has taken the place of the human retina
in recording celestial phenomena, especially
among the stars and nebulæ. Not only
are the forms of such objects now exclusively
recorded by photography, but the spectra
of all kinds of celestial objects—sun, stars,
nebulæ, etc.—are photographed and afterward
studied at leisure. In this way many of the
most important discoveries of recent years
have been made, including those of variable
stars and new stars. Photographic charts
of the heavens exist, and by comparing these
with others made later, changes which would
escape the eye can be detected. Comets
are sometimes, and new asteroids almost
invariably, discovered by photography. The
changes in the spectra of comets and new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>stars are thus recorded with an accuracy that
would be otherwise unattainable. Photographs
of the moon excel in accuracy all
that can be done by manual drawing, and
while photographs of the planets still fail
to show many of the fine details visible with
telescopes, continual improvements are being
made. Many of the great telescopes now
in use or in course of construction are
intended specially for photographic work.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>3. The Constellations.</b> The division of
the stars into constellations constitutes the
uranography or the “geography of the
heavens.” The majority of the constellations
are very ancient, and their precise origin is
unknown, but those which are invisible
from the northern hemisphere have all been
named since the great exploring expeditions
to the south seas. There are more than
sixty constellations now generally recognised.
Twelve of these belong to the zodiac, and
bear the same names as the zodiacal signs,
although the precession of the equinoxes
has drifted them out of their original relation
to the signs. Many of the constellations
are memorials of prehistoric myths, and a
large number are connected with the story
of the Argonautic expedition and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>other famous Greek legends. Thus the
constellations form a pictorial scroll of
legendary history and mythology, and possess
a deep interest independent of the science
of astronomy. For their history and for
the legends connected with them, the reader
who desires a not too detailed résumé, may
consult <i>Astronomy with the Naked Eye</i>, and
for guidance in finding the constellations,
<i>Astronomy with an Opera-glass</i>, or <i>Round
the Year with the Stars</i>. The quickest way to
learn the constellations is to engage the aid
of some one who knows them already, and
can point them out in the sky. The next
best way is to use star charts, or a star-finder
or planisphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>A considerable number of the brighter and
more important stars are known by individual
names, such as Sirius, Canopus,
Achernar, Arcturus, Vega, Rigel, Betelgeuse,
Procyon, Spica, Aldebaran, Regulus, Altair,
and Fomalhaut. Astronomers usually designate
the principal stars of each constellation
by the letters of the Greek alphabet,
α, β, γ, etc., the brightest star in the constellation
bearing the name of the first
letter, the next brightest that of the second
letter, and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>The constellations are very irregular in
outline, and their borders are only fixed
with sufficient definiteness to avoid the
inclusion of stars catalogued as belonging
to one, within the limits of another. In all
cases the names come from some fancied
resemblance of the figures formed by the
principal stars of the constellation to a man,
woman, animal, or other object. In only
a few cases are these resemblances very
striking.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most useful constellations for the
beginner are those surrounding the north
celestial pole, and we give a little circular
chart showing their characteristic stars.
The names of the months running round the
circle indicate the times of the year when
these constellations are to be seen on or
near the meridian in the north. Turn the
chart so that the particular month is at the
bottom, and suppose yourself to be facing
northward. The hour when the observation
is supposed to be made is, in every case,
about 9 o'clock in the evening, and the date
is about the first of the month. The top of
the chart represents the sky a little below
the zenith in the north, and the bottom
represents the horizon in the north.</p>

<div id='i244'  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 18. The North Circumpolar Stars.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The apparent yearly revolution of the
heavens, resulting from the motion of the
earth in its orbit, causes the constellations
to move westward in a circle round the pole,
at the rate of about 30° per month. But the
daily rotation of the earth on its axis causes
a similar westward motion of the heavens,
at the rate of about 30° for every two hours.
From this it results that on the same night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>after an interval of two hours, you will see the
constellations occupying the place that they
will have, at the original hour of observation,
one month later. Thus, if you observe their
positions at 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on the first of January, and
then turn the chart so as to bring February at
the bottom, you will see the constellations
around the north pole of the heavens placed as
they will be at 11 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on the first of January.</p>

<div id='i245'  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>Fig. 19. Key to North Circumpolar Stars.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Only the conspicuous stars have been
represented in the chart, just enough being
included to enable the learner to recognise
the constellations by their characteristic
star groups, from which they have received
their names. The chart extends to a distance
of 40° from the pole, so that, for
observers situated in the mean latitude of
the United States, none of the constellations
represented ever descends below the horizon,
those that are at the border of the chart
just skimming the horizon when they are
below the pole.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the key to the chart the Greek-letter
names of the principal stars have been attached,
but some of them have other names
which are more picturesque. These are
as follows: In Ursa Major (the Great Bear,
which includes the Great Dipper), α is
called Dubhe, β Merak, γ Phaed, δ Megrez,
ε Alioth, ζ Mizar, and η Benetnash. The
little star close by Mizar is Alcor. In
Cassiopeia, α is called Schedar, β Caph,
and δ Ruchbar. In Ursa Minor, the Little
Bear, α is called Polaris, or the North Star,
and β Kochab. In Draco, α is called Thuban,
and γ Eltanin. In Cepheus, α is called
Alderamin, and β Alfirk. These names are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>nearly all of Arabic origin. It will be observed
that Merak and Dubhe are the
famous “Pointers,” which serve to indicate
the position of the North Star, while Thuban
is the “star of the pyramid,” before mentioned.
The north celestial pole is situated
almost exactly on a straight line drawn from
Mizar through the North Star to Ruchbar,
and a little more than a degree from the
North Star in the direction of Ruchbar.
This furnishes a ready means for ascertaining
the position of the meridian. For instance,
about the middle of October, Mizar is very
close to the meridian below the pole, and
Ruchbar equally close to it above the pole,
and then, since the North Star is in line with
these two, it also must be practically on
the meridian, and its direction indicates
very nearly true north. The same method
is applicable whenever, at any other time
of the year or of the night, Mizar and
Ruchbar are observed to lie upon a vertical
line, no matter which is above and which
below. It is also possible to make a very
good guess at the time of night by knowing
the varying position of the line joining
these stars.</p>

<p class='c008'>The star Caph is an important landmark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>because it lies almost on the great circle
of the equinoctial colure, which passes through
the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the key, the location of the North Pole
of the Ecliptic is shown, and the greater
part of the circle described by the north
celestial pole in the period of 25,800 years.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the reader who wishes to pursue
the study of the constellations in detail
must be referred to some of the works
before mentioned, or others of like character,
it is possible here to aid him in making a
preliminary acquaintance with other constellations
beside those included in our little
chart, by taking each of the months in turn,
and describing the constellations which he
will see on or near the meridian south of the
border of the chart at the same time that
the polar constellations corresponding to
the month selected are on or near the meridian
in the north. Thus, at 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> about
the first of January, the constellation Perseus,
lying in a rich part of the Milky Way,
is nearly overhead and directly south of the
North Star. This constellation is marked by
a curved row of stars, the brightest of which,
of the second magnitude, is Algenib, or α
Persei. A few degrees south-west of Algenib
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>is the wonderful variable Algol. East of
Perseus is seen the very brilliant white star
Capella in the constellation Auriga. This
is one of the brightest stars in the sky.
Almost directly south of Perseus, the eye
will be caught by the glimmering cluster
of the Pleiades in the constellation Taurus.
A short distance south-east of the Pleiades
is the group of the Hyades in Taurus, shaped
like the letter V, with the beautiful reddish
star Aldebaran in the upper end of the
southern branch of the letter. The ecliptic
runs between the Pleiades and the Hyades.
Still lower in the south will be seen a part
of the long-winding constellation Eridanus,
the River Po. Its stars are not bright but
they appear in significant rows and streams.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the first of February the constellation
Auriga is on the meridian not far from
overhead, Capella lying toward the west.
Directly under Auriga, two rather conspicuous
stars mark the tips of the horns of
Taurus, imagined as a gigantic bull, and
south of these, with its centre on the equator,
scintillates the magnificent constellation
Orion, the most splendid in all the sky,
with two great first-magnitude stars, one,
in the shoulder of the imaginary giant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>of an orange hue, called Betelguese, and the
other in the foot, of a blue-white radiance,
called Rigel. Between these is stretched
the straight line of the “belt,” consisting
of three beautiful second-magnitude stars,
about a degree and a half apart. Their
names, beginning with the western one,
are Mintaka, Alnilam, and Alnitah. Directly
under the belt, in the midst of a short
row of faint stars called the “sword,” is
the great Orion nebula. It will be observed
that the three stars of the belt point, though
not exactly, toward the brightest of all
stars, Sirius, in the constellation Canis Major,
the Great Dog, which is seen advancing from
the east. Under Orion is a little constellation
named Lepus, the Hare.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of March the region overhead is
occupied by the very faint constellation
Lynx. South of it, and astride the ecliptic,
appear the constellations Gemini, the Twins,
and Cancer, the Crab. These, like Taurus,
belong to the zodiac. The Twins are westward
from Cancer, and are marked by two
nearly equal stars, about five degrees apart.
The more westerly and northerly one is
Castor and the other is Pollux. Cancer
is marked by a small cluster of faint stars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>called Præsepe, the Manger (also sometimes
the Beehive). Directly south of the Twins,
is the bright lone star Procyon, in the constellation
Canis Minor, the Little Dog.
Sirius and the other stars of Canis Major,
which make a striking figure, are seen south-west
of Procyon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of April the zodiac constellation
Leo is near the meridian, recognisable by
a sickle-shaped figure marking the head and
breast of the imaginary Lion. The bright
star at the end of the handle of the sickle
is Regulus. Above Leo, between it and the
Great Dipper, appears a group of stars
belonging to the small constellation Leo
Minor, the Little Lion. Farther south is
a winding ribbon of stars indicating the
constellation Hydra, the Water Serpent.
Its chief star, Alphard, of a slightly reddish
tint, is seen west of the meridian and a few
degrees south of the equator.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the beginning of May, when the Great
Dipper is nearly overhead, the small constellation
Canes Venatici, the Hunting Dogs,
is seen directly under the handle of the
Dipper, and south of that a cobwebby spot,
consisting of minute stars, indicates the
position of the constellation Coma Berenices,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Berenice's Hair. Still farther south, where
the ecliptic and the equator cross, at the
autumnal equinox, is the large constellation
Virgo, the Virgin, also one of the zodiacal
band. Its chief star Spica, a pure white
gem, is seen some 20° east of the meridian.
Below and westward from Virgo, and south
of the equator, are the constellations Crater,
the Cup, and Corvus, the Crow. The stars
of Hydra continue to run eastward below
these constellations. The westernmost, Crater,
consists of small stars forming a rude
semicircle open toward the east, while Corvus,
which possesses brighter stars, has the form
of a quadrilateral.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of June the great golden star
Arcturus, whose position may be found by
running the eye along the curve of the handle
of the Great Dipper, and continuing onward
a distance equal to the whole length of the
Dipper, is seen approaching the meridian
from the east and high overhead. This
superb star is the leader of the constellation
Boötes, the Bear-Driver. Spica in Virgo is
now a little west of the meridian.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of July, when the centre of Draco
is on the meridian north of the zenith, the
exquisite circlet of stars called Corona
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Borealis, the Northern Crown, is nearly
overhead. A short distance north-east of
it appears a double-quadrilateral figure,
marking out the constellation Hercules,
while directly south of the Crown a crooked
line of stars trending eastward indicates the
constellation Serpens, the Serpent. South-west
of Serpens, two widely separated but
nearly equal stars of the second magnitude
distinguish the zodiacal constellation Libra,
the Balance; while lower down toward
the south-east appears the brilliant red star
Antares, in the constellation Scorpio, likewise
belonging to the zodiac.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the first of August the head of Draco
is on the meridian near the zenith, and south
of it is seen Hercules, toward the west, and
the exceedingly brilliant star Vega, in the
constellation Lyra, the Lyre, toward the
east. Vega, or Alpha Lyræ, has few rivals
for beauty. Its light has a decided bluish-white
tone, which is greatly accentuated
when it is viewed with a telescope. South
of Hercules two or three rows of rather
large, widely separated stars mark the
constellation Ophiuchus, the Serpent-Bearer.
This extends across the equator. Below it,
in a rich part of the Milky Way, is Scorpio,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>whose winding line, beginning with Antares
west of the meridian, terminates a considerable
distance east of the meridian in a pair of
stars representing the uplifted sting of the
imaginary monster.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first of September the Milky Way runs
directly overhead, and in the midst of it
shines the large and striking figure called
the Northern Cross, in the constellation
Cygnus, the Swan. The bright star at the
head of the Cross is named Denib. Below
the Cross and in the eastern edge of the
Milky Way is the constellation Aquila, the
Eagle, marked by a bright star, Altair,
with a smaller one on each side and not
far away. Low in the south, a little west
of the meridian and partly immersed in
the brightest portion of the Milky Way,
is the zodiacal constellation Sagittarius,
the Archer. It is distinguished by a group
of stars several of which form the figure
of the upturned bowl of a dipper, sometimes
called the Milk Dipper. East of
Cygnus and Aquila a diamond-shaped figure
marks the small constellation Delphinus,
the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the opening of October, when Denib
is near the meridian, the sky directly in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>south is not very brilliant. Low down,
south of the equator, is seen the zodiacal
constellation Capricornus, the Goat, with
a noticeable pair of stars in the head of the
imaginary animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the first of November, when Cassiopeia
is approaching the meridian overhead, the
Great Square, in the constellation Pegasus,
is on the meridian south of the zenith,
while south-west of Pegasus the zodiacal
constellation Aquarius, the Water-Bearer,
appears on the ecliptic. A curious scrawling
Y-shaped figure in the upper part of Aquarius
serves as a mark to identify the constellation.
Thirty degrees south of this shines the bright
star Fomalhaut, in the constellation Piscis
Australis, the Southern Fish. The two
stars forming the eastern side of the Great
Square of Pegasus are interesting because,
like Caph in Cassiopeia, they lie close to the
line of the equinoctial colure. The northern
one is called Alpheratz and the southern
Gamma Pegasi. Alpheratz is a star claimed
by two constellations, since it not only marks
one corner of the square of Pegasus, but
it also serves to indicate the head of the
maiden in the celebrated constellation of
Andromeda.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>The first of December, Andromeda is seen
nearly overhead, south of Cassiopeia. The
constellation is marked by a row of three
second-magnitude stars, beginning on the
east with Alpheratz and terminating near
Perseus with Almaack. The central star is
named Mirach. A few degrees north-west
of Mirach glimmers the great Andromeda
nebula. Below Andromeda, west of the
meridian, appears the zodiacal constellation
Aries, the Ram, indicated by a group of
three stars, forming a triangle, the brightest
of which is called Hamal. South-westerly
from Aries is the zodiacal constellation Pisces,
the Fishes, which consists mainly of faint
stars arranged in pairs and running far toward
the west along the course of the ecliptic,
which crosses the equator at the vernal
equinox, near the western end of the constellation.
South of Pisces and Aries is
the broad constellation Cetus, the Whale,
marked by a number of large quadrilateral
and pentagonal figures, formed by its stars.
Near the centre of this constellation, but
not ordinarily visible to the naked eye, is
the celebrated variable Mira, also known as
Omicron Ceti.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a little application any person can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>learn to recognise these constellations, even
with the slight aid here offered, and if he
does, he will find the knowledge thus acquired
as delightful as it is useful.</p>
